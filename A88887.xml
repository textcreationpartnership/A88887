            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </gap>f your knowledge, the ſame tenderneſse I have had for the <hi>French Apothecaries;</hi> I ſhall then advertiſe
<pb facs="tcp:170969:9"/>you, that 'tis near five and thirty yeares ſince I was firſt addicted to <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> and that by a Father that was in his profeſsion moſt exact, who employ'd himſelf particularly in the curious ſearches into things neceſſary for the Election, Preparation, and Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Medicines, which he kept in his Shop, to diſpoſe of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the precept and orders of the Phyſitians. I may ſay, as he was my Father, ſo he was my Maſter, from whom I received the firſt Elements of <hi>Pharmacy</hi> and <hi>Chymiſtry;</hi> who likewiſe in the firſt place enjoyned me to obſerve that excellent principle, <hi>viz.</hi> to exerciſe my Profeſsion with Fidelity, ſuffering nothing to diſcredit the dignity of this Art: But above all, to follow punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the directions of the Phyſitians, which ought to be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from whence all firſt receive the Noble knowledge of true Natural things, and the manner of preparing them well.</p>
                  <p>But this excellent Patron, by whom <hi>I</hi> ought to ſquare all the Actions of my beſt life and Profeſsion, ſoon forſook me, leaving me full of nothing but grief for his loſſe, and a true Prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the decay of <hi>Pharmacy.</hi> For he foreſaw that the body of the Phyſitians was divided in ſuch a manner, that the branches were ſeparated from the Roots, and that the nouriſhment neceſſary for their ſubſiſtance muſt fail them, without queſtion, if he did not effect a good reunion, that might oblige the Phyſitians to continue their ſtudies and ſearches into Naturals, and ſo communicate them to the Apothecaries. And theſe ought to receive them with due reſpect and gratitude, to the end that they might jointly dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themſelves to the Publick good, without farther rending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by partialitie and particular interest, which hath ever been the ruin of thoſe that are willing to indulge themſelves from their due endeavour. Now when I ſaw my ſelf deprived of the inſtructions of a Father and a Maſter, I applyed my ſelf wholly to follow his laſt precepts. Whereupon I ſearcht among the dead for thoſe Phyſitians that had written beſt of <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe living, thoſe that did practiſe beſt, and did labour
<pb facs="tcp:170969:9"/>daily to imbelliſh it by their new doctrines, and ſupplyes of good and wholſome Remedics. 'Twas my good fortune to finde at <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> (which was then the place where I was ſetled) one Dr. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> deceaſed, Dr. of Phyſick, and profeſſor of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> who did me the favour to inſtruct and ſhew me much; 'Twas of this great Man that I confeſſe I receiv'd whatever did by degrees promote in me that good deſign of diligent ſearching into Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical verities, becauſe thoſe notions are abſolutely neceſſary for our Apothecary, that would acquit himſelf well in his profeſsion with requiſite fidelity; and I can ſay in commendation of his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Genius, that <hi>France</hi> hath ſuffered much by his untimely death; for he was deſigning then to publiſh ſome Writings, which would have much illuſtrated the knowledge of things <hi>Natural, Medicine</hi> &amp; <hi>Pharmacy.</hi> He had Anatomiſed Nature in General and particular ſufficiently to acquit himſelf honorably of what he had undertaken, had he not been raviſht hence ſo ſoon to the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite loſſe of the Common-wealth of Learning. Afterwards at <hi>Paris,</hi> I had the happineſſe of liberty to converſe with <hi>M. du Clos</hi> Dr. of Phyſick, who did me the favour to correct my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults, and lead me as by the hand of his judgement and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, through all that which I have undertaken in my endeavors to advance the dignity of <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> which now lies bending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward its ruine, if it be not upheld by its true Arches and Pillars, thoſe faithful, learned, experienc'd and curious Phyſitians. This Excellent and rare Phyſitian denyed me none of thoſe lights, or illuſtrations, that are neceſſary for the well-doing of thoſe that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict themſelves to the legitimate preparation of <hi>Pharmacy;</hi> ſo that I am indebted to Him for the well-being I have acquired in my Profeſsion. Thus I have continued, till at length I was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſome years ſince by the favor of <hi>Monſ. Vallot,</hi> the moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Chief Phyſitian to our moſt invincible <hi>Monarch,</hi> as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary and Diſtiller in ordinary to the King, to perform by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts &amp; order leſſons and operations in a courſe of the true <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I have given you this account of the progreſse I made in <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> to the end that you may ſee the method of making your own advantage, and to diſcover to you the reaſonable ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that you and we do, and alwayes ſhall owe to our illuſtrious Maſters. You muſt know then by this that I am about to ſay, that I give you nothing here but what hath been received from the Phyſitians, ſo that it is to them only to whom you owe the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. And as for my publiſhing this Tract of <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> 'tis becauſe I would imitate the moſt eminent Authors of <hi>Germany,</hi> who thought themſelves obliged to write of <hi>Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Pharmacy</hi> in the vulgar Tongue, that it might likewiſe be uſeful not only to the Apothecaries, but, that it might likewiſe be ſerviceable to men of other profeſsions. For as much as is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to write with order and method of that which is neceſſary to Art, when we declare not, nor illuſtrate at the ſame time the principles of things Natural; and moreover, becauſe we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver not the order of the generation, and corruption Phyſical, from which all the effects of Nature do reſult which are the ſubject of the operation as well of the one as the other <hi>Pharmacy.</hi>

                  <p>I have likewiſe publiſht it, to contribute to the publick good in general, and yours in particular; For as I have never had a greater ambition then to ſee <hi>Pharmacy</hi> practiced in its true lustre, which I now ſee vilified and neglected, and as I am fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this profeſsion under the protection of one of the chiefeſt of all Phyſitians, one that entertains the highest and moſt generous deſign for its eſtabliſhment; ſo likewiſe will I guide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you by the Theory and practice of this Treatiſe of <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry</hi> to a fair, exact, faithful and veritable profeſsion of our Art.</p>
                  <p>You will learn hence <hi>Readers,</hi> as in other Tracts of <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> abundance of things, their true and legitimate prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from whence muſt follow neceſſarily a good and agreeable Compoſition. I have undertaken this labour for your uſe, becauſe I have never yet found one that hath taken the paines or care to ſhew and diſcover punctually the manner of operating upon things to preſerve their vertue, and correct their defaults.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, You may obſerve the difference there is of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of thoſe Medicaments which are made according to the opinions and directions of the Antient <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> with that which is ſhew'd and commanded by the Modern.</p>
                  <p>You may obſerve likewiſe the envy and malice of thoſe that carp at and rail againſt <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> and how ignorantly they averre, that this admirable Art is not occupied by its followers, but on poyſons, when you will finde the Treatiſe of the Chymical prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Animals</hi> as well as <hi>Vegetables.</hi> Laſtly, You will finde the difference that there is in the <hi>modus faciendi</hi> of the Ancient <hi>Pharmacy</hi> with the judicial, intelligent and reaſonable government of Chymical Artiſts, for the ſeparation of the pure from the impure, and for the preſervation of that which cauſes the efficacy and the vertue in things.</p>
                  <p>You may and ought to believe, <hi>Readers,</hi> That though I have not made all the preparations that are deſcribed in this Tract, yet
<pb facs="tcp:170969:11"/>nevertheleſſe I have tryed the greater part, and may therefore judge of the poſsibility of their operation and the liberality and vertue of things by the practice and experience in other works which daily paſſe my hands. If you do but examine thoſe Authors that have given you the deſcription of ſome things, I will leave it to your diſcretion to judge the paines I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to denote to you thoſe little obſervations which are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for operating, and without which it is impoſsible to avoid failing. I have followed the Method and Order of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and expert Phyſitian <hi>Schrederus</hi> who is yet living and a Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiary to the City of <hi>Francfort,</hi> to whom all Apothecaries are greatly obliged for the excellent Chymical Diſpenſatory he hath publiſht.

                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Readers,</hi> I deſire with the greateſt paſsion that this may redound to the glory of Medicine, to the advancement of the one and other <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> but above all to your good and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſatisfaction.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hey that reckon Chymiſtry amongſt the modern Arts, and of but late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, betray their knowledge both in the hiſtory of Nature, and the reading of ancient Authors: Since, in the firſt place, Chymiſtry is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Art and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Nature it ſelf; that it is by her means we examine the Principles, out of which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural bodies do conſiſt and are compounded; and by her are diſcovered unto us the cauſes and ſources of their generations and corruptions, and of all the changes and alterations to which they are lyable: And ſecondly, it is known, that the ancient Sages have taken from Chymiſtry, the occaſions and true motives of reaſoning upon natural things, and that their monuments and writings do teſtifie this Art to be of no freſher date then Nature it ſelf. To this do agree the teſtimony of the holy Scriptures, by whom we are taught, that even in the Worlds Infancy, <hi>Tubal-Cain</hi> the eighth of Mankinde from <hi>Adam,</hi> deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170969:12"/>of <hi>Cain</hi>'s line, was an expert Artiſt in all Braſs and Iron works, which he could not have been without a previous knowledge of Minerals, and without being well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Mineral nature contains in it ſelf and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the Metallick, as the pureſt part of its eſſence. But this knowledge cannot be attained unto, but by the help and skill of <hi>Chymiſtry;</hi> ſince it is by this Art we are informed, how a metallick, malleable and ductile body, may be extracted out of brickle and inform Minerals. Whence we do ſafely conclude, that he did receive this noble Art from his Predeceſſors, or being himſelf the inventor of it, left it to Poſterity, as the richeſt Jewel they could inherit from him. This Aſſertion may be proved by the moſt ancient of Authors, and moſt worthy of credit; and ſo we have upon record, that <hi>Moſes</hi> took the Golden Calf, an Idol of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> did calcine it, and being by him reduced to powder, cauſed thoſe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to drink it, in a reproach and puniſhment of their ſin. But no body, how little ſoever initiated in the myſteries of this Art, can be ignorant, that Gold is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Powder by Calcination, unleſſe it be performed either by immerſion in Regal Waters, Amamulgation with Mercury, or Projection; all which three Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are only obvious to thoſe which are fully acquainted both with the Theorical and Practical part of Chimiſtry. This truth is confirmed by <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> when in his Book <hi>de Diaeta,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Artifices aurum molli igne liquant:</hi> and all experimented Artiſts know, that Gold is not to be melted without ſome violence of fire, and that the action of fire doth rather purifie it, then deſtroy it, unleſs it be made tractable and volatile by the help of certain ſalts and powders, only known to few perſons; and thoſe ſpecially who have had their hands in the work, and by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170969:12"/>practice attained the ſecrets of the Art. We could joyn to this, the authority of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> made uſe of by his Sectators of this Age, to oppoſe Chymiſtry, who ſaith, That the Inhabitants of <hi>Umbria,</hi> were wont to calcine Reeds, thereby to extract a ſalt out of them for their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary uſe; which they would not have undertook with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being firſt taught by the principles of this Art, that Salt is a body of an uncorruptible nature, which by this vulgar calcination could not be deſtroyed: And if we run over all Ages ſince the Worlds Creation, we ſhall ſcarce finde any wherein ſome great man hath not raiſed himſelf a name to live in the remembrance of Poſterity, by the help of Chymical learning. Witneſſe the <hi>Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian Mercury,</hi> or famous <hi>Triſmegiſt,</hi> whoſe works do at this day exerciſe the underſtanding of the greateſt wits: Witneſſe the firſt inventor of Glaſſe; and that other more skilfull Artiſt, which had attained to that admirable ſecret of making it malleable, and dyed with it, by the ſtrange and tyrannical policy of the Emperour <hi>Tiberius.</hi> And do not <hi>Geber, Raymundus Lullius, Peter</hi> of <hi>Apona, Baſilius Valentinus, Iſaac</hi> the <hi>Hollander,</hi> and <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> ſufficiently prove by their incomparable works, that Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry is the true Key of Nature; that by her means the expert Artiſt diſcovers her hidden beauty, aad that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her aid, no man ſhall ever attain to the true prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of thoſe remedies, which are only capable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with that <hi>Hydra</hi> of various diſeaſes wherewith humane nature is daily afflicted and aſſaulted? But we ſhould prove ungratefull to our Age, and the memory of a moſt worthy and charitable Phyſician, and to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of one of the moſt ingenious and exact Artiſts that ever was, if we ſhould paſſe by unmentioned the <hi>ſubtil Van Helmont</hi> lately deceaſed, and the <hi>laborious Glauber,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:170969:13"/>yet living, ſince they are as the two Beacons and Lights which we are to follow in the Theory of Chymiſtry, and the beſt practice of it: From their works then, and <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> we acknowledge to have compiled this <hi>Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Theorical</hi> and <hi>Practical Chymiſtry,</hi> which we ſhall divide in two parts: The firſt containing the Theory, the ſecond the Practice of the Art: The firſt part divided in two Books, ſhall treat in the firſt, of the Principles and Elements of Natural things; and in the ſecond, diſcover the ſprings and effects of purity and impurity in them: The ſecond part ſhall alſo be divided into two Books; the firſt whereof is to contain all the neceſſary terms, both to reduce in practice, and underſtand the operations of the whole Art; and the ſecond and laſt of all, ſhall open the means, and give a plain deſcription, whereby to anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize all mixt bodies, whether Vegetables, Animals, or Minerals, and thence to extract ſuch remedies as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the cure of our diſeaſes. But before the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal matter be entred upon, I have not thought it unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for the Readers ſatisfaction, to clear ſome few Queries, which uſe to be moved, touching the nature of this Noble Art.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Quaery. <hi>If Chymiſtry ought to be called Art or Science? and of its definition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before we enter into the definition of Chymiſtry, it's neceſſary to examine her <hi>genus</hi> and difference, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of both which is neceſſary, before a true definition of things can be given. We muſt then examine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be an Art or a Science, before we can define it's true <hi>genus,</hi> and ſeek its difference in the object; ſince there is no part more eſſential in its definition. But to avoyd difficulties and intricacy, let us in few words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the differency between Art and Science, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral acceptions incident to the name of Chymiſtry.</p>
                  <p>The differency aſſigned between Art and Science, is only to be taken from the diverſity of their intentional ends or purpoſes: For as it is the only ſcope of a Science to contemplate, and its end to attain knowledge by that contemplation, wherein it doth reſt ſatisfied without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the minde to a further inquity: So Art is only bent
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170969:14"/>to operation, and never ceaſeth untill it hath brought the purpoſes of the Artiſt to a deſired accompliſhment. Whence we may inferre, that Science is only of ſuch things as are not in our power, and that Art doth buſie it ſelf upon ſuch things as are in our power. This being granted, we muſt know, that as Chymiſtry is of a great extent, ſo it hath alſo ſeveral ends, and that as it hath all the ſphere of Nature for its object, ſome things are under the power and reach of its diſciples, others not; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe two kindes of ſubjects, which are wholly of a different nature, there is a third ſort, partly under their power, and partly not: Whence we may in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner conclude, that there are <hi>three ſpecies of Chymiſtry;</hi> the one wholly Scientifical and given to Contemplation, and may be very well tearmed <hi>Philoſophical,</hi> having only its end in the knowledge of Nature, and of its effects; becauſe it takes for object thoſe on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y things which are conſtituted out of our power: So that this kinde of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Philoſophy, doth reſt ſatisfied in the knowledge of the nature of the Heavens and Starres, the ſource and original of the Elements, the cauſe of Meteors, original of Minerals, and the way by which Plants and Animals are propagated; having not in her power to frame or make any one of all theſe things, but being ſufficiently pleaſed with entertaining her diſcourſe and reaſon upon the cauſes of ſo many various effects. The ſecond <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Chymiſtry may be called <hi>Iatrochymy</hi> of Medicinal Chymiſtry, whoſe only end is operation; but not to be attained, unleſſe by the means and helping hand of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative and Scientifical Chymiſtry: for as the art of Phyſick, conſiſts in two parts, Theory and Practice; the former being but a Clue and help to lead unto the other: ſo ſhall alſo Iatrochymy participate of both; the end of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170969:15"/>its contemplating being only Operation, and that ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration again purpoſing only the ſatisfaction of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples mindes, about the Contemplation both of things that are, and are not in our power. The third <hi>ſpecies</hi> is <hi>Pharmaceutical Chymiſtry,</hi> which hath for its end only operation, belonging to the Apothecary's profeſſion, who is to direct his work by the Precepts and Orders of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trochymiſts: ſuch as amongſt the <hi>French</hi> Phyſicians is eminent at this day, <hi>Monſieur Vallot,</hi> firſt Phyſician to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, who doth eminently poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe the Theory and Practice of thoſe three <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Chymiſtry which we have ſpoken of. This third <hi>ſpecies</hi> or kinde, hath for its object thoſe things which come under our power to operate on them, and extract thoſe different parts which conſtitute the compound thereof. Whence, from all that is above ſaid, we may conclude, That <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> may be called both Science and Art in ſeveral reſpects, and ſo conſequently <hi>a practical or opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Science.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus having found the <hi>genus,</hi> it remains we ſhould finde the Difference, to compleat the definition. Some do define <hi>Chymiſtry, The art of Tranſmutations;</hi> others, <hi>The art of Separations;</hi> others, of both Tranſmutations and Separations: But as Tranſmutation and Separation are the effects of Chymiſtry, they cannot conſtitute its true and ſpecifical Difference. There are ſeveral other wayes of definition uſed by others, but which do all come to what we have already ſaid; therefore we muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity take the Difference from its Object, as it is above deduced. Some Authors make the <hi>object of Chymiſtry</hi> to be, Mixt bodies: but they are deceived; for the Elements which are unmixt bodies, are alſo under the verge of this Science: Others would have it the Natural body; but
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170969:15"/>they alſo are deceived; ſince Chymiſtry hath under its conſideration the univerſal ſpirit, which is diveſted of all corporeity. We ſay then, that Chymiſtry makes all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, extracted by the omnipotent had of God, in the Creation, out of the Abyſſe of the Chaos, her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and adaequate object. But it is to be noted, that by natural things we do not underſtand bodies only, as they are ſaid to be compoſed of matter and form, but that we mean all created things, though deprived of bodies; and by oppoſing things natural to ſupernatural, there will be a ſufficient diſtinction ſet between the Creator and Creatures, to take away that reproach wherewith the Profeſſors of this Noble Science, are ordinarily ſpotted and traduced. Chymiſtry is then thus defined, <hi>A practical and operative Science</hi> (or knowledge) <hi>or things natural.</hi> It is a Science, as is already ſaid, becauſe it contemplates natural things; but becauſe it doth not end or reſt in Contemplation alwayes, but alters ſometimes natural things by the means and help of others, it may be called an operative or practical Science. To make ſhort, It's nothing elſe but Phyſick, or knowledge of Nature it ſelf, reduced to operation, and examining all it's Propoſitions by reaſons grounded upon the evidence and teſtimony of the ſenſes, and not relying upon bare and naked contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation. This is then the difference between the Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal-Phyſician, or Naturaliſt, and he that followes the Schools, or Dogmatical way; that, if you ask from the former, What parts do conſtitute a body, he will not give you a naked Anſwer, and ſatisfie by words and meer diſcourſe your curioſity, but he will endeavour to bring his demonſtrations under your ſight, and ſatisfie alſo your other ſenſes, by making you to touch, ſmell and taſte the very parts which enter'd in the compoſition of the body in queſtion, knowing very well that what remains after
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170969:16"/>the reſolution of the mixt, according to the rules of Art, was that very ſubſtance that conſtituted it. But if you ask from the School-Philoſopher, What doth make the compound of a body? He will anſwer you, that it is not yet well determined in the Schools: That, to be a body, it ought to have quantity, and conſequently to be diviſible; that a body ought to be compoſed of things diviſible and indiviſible, that is to ſay, of points and parts: but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be compoſed of points, for a point is indiviſible, and without quantity, and conſequently cannot communicate any quantity to the body, ſince it hath none in it ſelf; ſo that the anſwer ſhould have concluded the body to be compoſed of diviſible parts. But againſt this alſo will be objected, If it be ſo, let us know, whether the minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the body is diviſible or no; if it be anſwered, Diviſible, then it is inſtanced again, that it is not the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteſt, ſince there is yet a place left for diviſion: but if this minuteſt part be affirmed to be indiviſible, then the anſwer falleth again into the former difficulty, ſince it returns to affirm it a point, and conſequently without quantity; of which being deprived, it is impoſſible it ſhould communicate the ſame to the body, ſince diviſibility is an eſſential property to quantity. You ſee then, that Chymiſtry doth reject ſuch airy and notional Arguments, to ſtick cloſe to viſible and palpable things, as it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the practice of this Art: For if we affirm, that ſuch a body is compounded of an acid ſpirit, a bitter or pontick ſalt, and a ſweet earth; we can make manifeſt by the touch, ſmell, taſte, thoſe parts which we extract, with all thoſe conditions we do attribute unto them.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth the third and laſt Query: <hi>What is the end of Chymiſtry?</hi> It is not to be wondered, that ordinary Naturaliſts have attained to ſo little light, in their ſearch and knowledge of natural bodies, ſince they did propoſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170969:16"/>to themſelves no other end but contemplation; thinking that it became not them to ſet their hands to the work, thereby to attain a true knowledge of mixt bodies by Chymical Anatomy: They and their Sectators alſo, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining they ſhould wrong their Gravity and Doctoral State, to defile and ſully their hands with the blackneſſe of Coals. Much contrary hath been at all times the practice of Chymical Philoſophers, though they made, as well as they, Contemplation their end: For they were perſwaded, Practice and Operation were to be joyned, to receive a full delight and ſatisfaction, and lay firm and ſure foundations to their Reaſonings; unwilling to build upon the quick-ſands of vain, frivolous, and fantaſtical opinions; which made them willingly undergo the charges, toyl and labour of Practical Chymiſtry; and not be diſcouraged by Watchings, and ill Savours, that they might attain the ſooner to a ſolid an delightfull knowledge of the things of Nature, finding by the ſeveral experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Works and Proceſſes, the abſtruſe cauſes of its wonderfull effects, wherein they differ very much from the Empyricks; which do, without much reaſoning, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, obſcure and intricate all things.</p>
                  <p>We do then conclude and affirm, that Operation is truely the general end of Chymiſtry: For the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher operates, only the better to be able to contemplate; the Iatrochymiſt alſo to diſcover the better by his operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which Nature performs in the body of a ſound man, that he may be capable to reſtore health, when by ſickneſſe it becomes vitiated and diſordered. Laſtly, the <hi>Pharmaco</hi>-Chymiſt operates, only to furniſh wholſom and ſalutary remedies to the ſick Patients, according to the judicious Preſcriptions and Orders of the skilfull and learned Phyſician. Is it then to be wondred at, if Chymiſts do beſtow ſo much labour and induſtry in purchaſing this noble
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170969:17"/>knowledge, the perfection of which can never be attained without having firſt anatomized the greateſt part of Nature? For as it is neceſſary to diſſect the human body, if we will know its organical parts; ſo it is requiſite, before we can diſcover the faireſt and beſt part of natural ſubſtances, which are as it were hidden and involved within a ſecret rinde, that we ſhould open their compoſites. Whence it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a very difficult matter for any to attain to the exact knowledge of natural things, without the previous guidance of Chymiſtry, and being acquainted with all its parts; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any be reckoned a perfect Phyſician without the help of Hermetical Philoſophy, ſince it is the trueſt ground of Phyſick, and without which no Practitioner can deſerve any other title then that of <hi>Empyrick:</hi> For it is not a Gown, or degrees taken in Univerſities, which conſtitute the Phyſician, but a ſolid knowledge of Nature, grounded upon ſound Reaſon and mature judgement, improved by practice and experience. Whence it followeth, firſt, That Chymiſtry doth not meerly conſiſt in the skill of preparing well a Remedy, as many do erroneouſly imagine; but in the uſing of it with due circumſtances, and reſpect to the Theorems of Art, which is properly the true Phyſick: Secondly, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever meddles with Chymical remedies, without the previous grounds of Theory, can deſerve no other name then of an <hi>Empyrick,</hi> ſince he is altogether ignorant of the internal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſes of their effects, and cannot give the Phyſical reaſons, why he doth adminiſter ſuch a remedy, for ſuch and ſuch diſeaſe; being not ſufficiently grounded to know that theſe rare preſcriptions of Chymiſtry, have their remedies grounded, not upon the actions of firſt and ſecond qualities, but upon the ſpecifical and internal vertues of their Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Principles, as will more evidently appear in the ſequel of this Treatiſe.</p>

                              <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE title of this Chapter doth ſufficiently evidence the error of thoſe who maintain, that the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body is the only object of Chymiſtry, ſince it treats alſo of the Univerſal Spirit, which is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance voyd and diveſted of all Corporeity: hence it is, that with more reaſon, we did aſſign all natural things her adequate object, <hi>viz.</hi> all created things, both corporeal and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, viſible and inviſible; and that becauſe Chymiſtry doth not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170969:18"/>only teach, how a body may be ſpiritualized, but how a ſpirit alſo may be fixt to become a body. For after having made the general and particular Anatomy of Nature, and ſearched and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated to its very center, this noble Science hath found, that the ſpring and root of all things was a ſpiritual ſubſtance, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous and like unto it ſelf, to which ancient and modern Philoſophers have attributed ſeveral names, calling it a <hi>Vital ſubſtance, a Spirit of life, Light, Balſom of life, Vital Mummy, Natural heat, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Spirit, Mercury of life;</hi> and many more names, which to ſum up all here, would be needleſſe, ſince theſe are the principal appellations.</p>
                           <p>But as our Scope, in this firſt. Book, is, to treat of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Elements of natural things, it ſeemeth to ſtand with reaſon, that we ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>d in the firſt place ſpeak of the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, by which the others are principiated; which Principle is nothing elſe but Nature it ſelf, or that univerſal Spirit, which makes the ſubject matter of this Chapter.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> in his book of Vexations, ſaith, that <hi>Domus eſt ſemper mortua, ſed eam inhabitans vivit:</hi> By which myſterious and figurative ſpeech, he endeavours to teach us, that the ſtrength of Nature is not included in the mortal and corruptible body; but that it is to be ſought in that wonderfull ſeed which hides it ſelf under the ſhade of the body, who of it ſelf hath no ſtrength or vertue, but fetches it all from that ſeminal ſpirit which it contains; a thing manifeſtly demonſtrable in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of that body, during which the internal ſpirit doth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricate it ſelf a new one, yea many new ones, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the firſt: Which occaſioneth again our <hi>German Triſmegiſtus</hi> to ſay, that the power and vertue of death is effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; for then the ſpirit doth diſingage it ſelf from the bonds of the body, wherein he ſeemed to be fetter'd, and without efficacy, which he beginneth then to declare, when it ſhould ſeem more improbable. This truth is illuſtrated by the grain of Corn rotting in the earth: for the body being opened by that corruption, the internal ſeminal ſpirit therein incloſed, buds out, produceth a blade and ſtalk, and at the end of it an Ear, containing ſeveral grains of Corn, the very ſame in likeneſſe to that which periſhed and was rotten in the ground.</p>
                           <pb n="15" facs="tcp:170969:18"/>
                           <p>This ſpiritual ſubſtance, which is the primary and ſole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all things, contains in it ſelf three diſtinct, but not differing ſubſtances: For they are homogeneous, as we have already ſaid. But becauſe there is found in it, a heat, a moyſture, and a drought; and all three are diſtinct, but not differing; we ſay, that theſe three are but one eſſence, and the ſame radical ſubſtance; otherwiſe, as Nature is one, ſimple, and homogeneous, if the ſeminal Principles of theſe ſubſtances were <hi>heterogeneous,</hi> nothing would be found in nature one, ſimple, and homogeneous; which cannot be, in regard of the great inconveniences that would follow: For if heat did differ from moyſture, it could not be nouriſht and fed by it (which is notwithſtanding neceſſary to be granted true) becauſe nouriſhment is performed by things not differing, but of a like nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if the aliment ſhould prove in the beginning, different from the alimentated, it would be neceſſary before it could paſſe into the ſubſtance of the laſt ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it ſhould be diveſted of all difference and diſſimilar nature. Now it is granted on all hands, that radical moyſture is the laſt aliment of natural heat; whence it followeth, that it cannot be of a different nature: Moreover, if they did differ, each one would endeavour to produce its like, and the inteſtine warre, raiſed by this occaſion, hinder the generation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound. Let us then conclude, that this radical and fundamental ſubſtance of all things, is truely and really one in its eſſence, but hath a threefold denomination; for in reſpect of its natural heat and fire, it is called Sulphur; in reſpect of its moyſture, which is the food and aliment of this fire, Mercury; and finally, in reſpect of the radical drought, which is, as it were, the knot and cement of the fire and moyſture, it is called Salt; which we ſhall clear more particularly, when we treat hereafter of theſe three Principles by themſelves, and examine, whether or no the one may be tranſmutated or converted into the other.</p>
                           <p>Having thus much ſpoken of the nature and eſſence of this univerſal ſpirit, we muſt now examine it's original, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which it doth produce: And for the firſt point, it is not to be doubted, but that this ſpirit hath been created by the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of the firſt Cauſe, when it extracted this goodly fabrick of the world out of its nothing, and did harbour it in all the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170969:19"/>parts of this vaſt Machine, as the Poet doth acknowledge, when he ſaith,
<q>
                                 <l>Spiritus intus agit, totam<expan>

                              </q> For all the parts of the Univerſe are in continual need of its ſupply and preſence, as we diſcover by the effects; and if any by accident hath been deprived thereof, he immediately returns to poſſeſſe it, and taking its place, reſtores life by his arrival. So we ſee, that having extracted from the ſalt of Vitriol ſeveral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances therein contained, if the dead earth, or <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> be expoſed to the air, in ſome ſheltered place free from the waſhing of Rain, this ſpirit will not fail to return to it, being po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently attracted by this Matrix, whoſe earneſt longing it is to fill it ſelf with this ſpirit, which makes the principal part of all things exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent; for as things are only deſtinated to their operation, ſo can they not act, but by their efficient internal Principles. Therefore God, who ever works by the moſt compendious way, and will not every day buſie his Omnipotency in the creation of new ſubſtances, hath once for all created this Univerſal Spirit, and placed it every where, that he might operate all in all things.</p>
                           <p>And as this Spirit is univerſal, ſo can he not be ſpecificated but by the means of particular Ferments, which do print in it the Character and Idea of mixt bodies, to be made ſuch or ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate ſubſtances, according to the diverſity of Matrixes, which receive this Spirit in themſelves to make it a body. Thus in a Vitriolick Matrix, it becomes Vitriol; in an Arſenical, Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick; a Vegetable Matrix makes it a Plant; and ſo of all the reſt. But two things are here to be noted, the firſt, That when we ſay, that this Spirit is ſpecificated in ſuch or ſuch a Matrix, that we underſtand nothing elſe, but that this Spirit is imbodyed in ſuch or ſuch a Compound, according to the different Idea it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, by the means of particular ferment; and that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it may be extracted again out of this compound, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting it by the help of Art, of this groſſe body, to give it a more ſubtil one, and ſo bring it neerer its univerſal nature, and thus prepared, it doth manifeſt its own vertues much more
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170969:19"/>eminently. The ſecond thing obſervable is, that this ſpirit cannot return to its indifferency or univerſal nature, without having loſt firſt of all the Idea received from the Matrix, in which it was embodyed: I ſay, it muſt have loſt all this Idea, becauſe although theſe ſpirits have been diveſted of their bodies by Art, they do notwithſtanding preſerve yet, for a while, the character and print of their firſt body; as it evidently appears in an aire poyſoned with Realgarick and Arſenical ſpirits, which inviſibly fill it, and do flye up and down; but when it hath quite loſt this Idea, it reunites it ſelf with the univerſal ſpirit, and if it meets with any fruitfull Matrix, being yet impregnated of its Idea, then it embodyes it ſelf in ſeveral different compounds: as it is evident in Plants and Animals, which we ſee produced without ſeed, as Muſhroms, Nettles, Mice, Frogs, Inſects, and ſeveral other things; which to relate here, would be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</p>
                           <p>Thus much had we to ſay of the Univerſal Spirit, reſerving to ſpeak of the Matrixes which do ſpecifie and corporifie it, and communicate him the Idea and Character of ſuch a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate exiſtence or body, where we ſhall treat of Elements here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the ſeveral ſubſtances which are found after the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and Anatomy of the Compound.</head>
                           <p>WE may conſider three ſeveral wayes, the Principles and Elements which do conſtitute the Compound: <hi>Viz.</hi> Or before its compoſition, or after its reſolution, or whileſt they do yet compoſe and conſtitute the Mixt. In the foregoing Chapter we have demonſtrated the nature of Principles, before they enter in the compoſition of the body; now our task is, in this Chapter, to ſhew, what they are after the reſolution, and during the compoſition of the Mixt; which we will do the more
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170969:20"/>ſuccinctly and in general terms at preſent, in regard we ſhall fall again more particularly upon the ſame matter in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapters.</p>
                           <p>We have ſaid heretofore, that the Univerſal Spirit, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically contains in it ſelf the three firſt Subſtances, was indifferent and in order to be made all things; and that he was ſpecificated or embodyed, according to the Idea which it took from the Matrix wherein he was received; with the Minerals becoming Mineral, with Vegetables becoming a Plant, and with Animals Animal. Of this Idea we will ſpeak more hereafter, as alſo of the Matrixes which do communicate it to the ſame.</p>
                           <p>During the compoſition of the Mixt, this ſpirit retains the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Idea which it took in the Matrix. Thus if it hath taken the nature of Sulphur, and been impregnated with its Idea, it communicates to the Compound, all the vertues and qualities of Sulphur. The ſame is to be ſaid of Salt, and Mercury; for when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is ſpecificated, or (if it may be ſaid without barbariſm) Ideificated in any of theſe Principles, it ſhewes it immediately by its actions: Thus things are in their Compoſition either fine or volatil, liquid or ſolid, pure or impure, diſſolved or co-agula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and ſo of the reſt, according as this ſpirit contained more or leſſe Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, or more or leſſe mixture of the groſſeneſſe and terreſtreity of the Matrixes. But after theſe Principles are ſeparated one from the other, and from the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtreity and corporeity which they draw from their Matrixes, they make it plain enough by their powerfull effects, that it is in this ſtate they ought to be reduced, before they can work with efficacy, though they retain yet ſtill their character and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Idea. Thus ſome few drops of the true ſpirit of Wine will be more powerfull, then a whole glaſſe of this corporeal liquor wherein it was encloſed: A drop of ſpirit of Vitriol ſhall be of more effect then many ounces of the body. But you are to note alſo, that theſe powerfull effects and great vertues do laſt no longer in the ſpirits, than the Idea of the Mixt, whence they were extracted, remains with them: For as all things by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral circulation in Nature, which corporifies to ſpiritualize, and ſpiritualizeth again to corporifie, have a ſtrong tendency to their firſt Principle: ſo theſe ſpirits are ſtill buſie and working, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170969:20"/>to diveſt and free themſelves of the Ideas wherein they are fettered, that they may return to their firſt Principle, which is the Univerſal Spirit.</p>
                           <p>Theſe things being ſo cleared, it remains to ſee how many ſubſtances Chymiſtry findes in the reſolution of the Compounds, and what they are. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that the reſolution of things ſhewes their conſtitutive Principles: Upon this Axiom, hath its ground and baſis our Philoſophy, both by reaſon of the truth of it, and that Chymiſtry receives no Principles of ſenſible things but ſuch as are obvious to, and fall under the Judicatory of the ſenſes. And as the Anatomiſt hath found a certain number of ſimilar parts, which conſtitute the humane body, whereof he makes the ſubject of his Art; ſo doth the Chymiſt endeavour to finde out the number of primary and ſimilary ſubſtances of all Compounds, to exhibit them to the ſenſes, that they may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judge what was their Office whileſt yet joyned in their Mixt, having conſidered their vertue and efficacy, in this purity and abſtracted nature; thence the name of <hi>Senſal Philoſophy</hi> hath been by ſome given to the Chymiſt: For as the Anatomiſt doth make uſe of Raſors and other ſharp Tools in his Diſſections, to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the better the ſeveral parts of the human body, which is his chief object: The ſame doth the Chymical Artiſt, fetching his inſtruction from Nature it ſelf, to attain his end, which is nothing elſe but to joyn <hi>homogeneal</hi> and ſeparate <hi>heterogeneal</hi> things by the means of Heat; for he doth nothing elſe but contribute his care and labour, to regulate the firſt according to the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of natural Agents and Patients, thereby to reſolve the mixt bodies in their ſeveral ſubſtances, which he ſeparates and purifies afterwards; for the fire never relents or ſlackens its action, but rather drives it on and encreaſeth it, untill he findes no<note n="*">
                                 <hi>Or</hi> Diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar parts.</note> 
                              <hi>heterogeneity</hi> left in the Compound.</p>
                           <p>After that the Artiſt hath performed the Chymical reſolution of bodies, he doth finde laſt of all five kinde of ſubſtances, which Chymiſtry admits for the Principles and Elements of natural bodies, whereupon are layd the grounds of its Doctrine, becauſe in theſe five ſubſtances is found no Heterogeneity; theſe are, the Phlegmatick or wateriſh part, the Spirit or Mercury, the Sulphur
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170969:21"/>or Oyl, the Salt, and the Earth. Some give them other names; for it is free for every body to uſe their invention in ſuch a caſe, being a thing of no great importance to neglect Names, and leave a latitude of freedom to every one therein, provided you may agree in the ſubſtance.</p>
                           <p>Now, as the Mixts cannot ſubſiſt in their integrity and perfect ſtate, if you deprive them of any or theſe parts, ſo would alſo the knowledge of theſe ſubſtances prove defectuous, if they were ſeparated one from another: wherefore we are to conſider them, both abſolutely and reſpectively. Three of theſe ſubſtances offer themſelves to our ſight, by the help of Chymical Operation, under the form of a Liquor, which are the Phlegm or Water, the Spirit, and the Oyl; the two other in a ſolid body, <hi>viz.</hi> Salt and Earth. The Water and Earth are commonly called paſſive Principles, material and of leſſe efficacy then the other three; as contrary wiſe the Spirit or Mercury, Sulphur and Salt, are reckoned active and formal Principles, by reaſon of their pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trative and ſubtile vertue: Some do call the Earth and Water or Phlegm, Elements; and give the name of Principles to the three others. But if that definition which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath given to Principles, is eſſential, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Principia neque ex aliis, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ex ſe invicem fiunt;</hi> Experience doth teach us, that theſe Subſtances cannot properly bear the name of Principles; becauſe we have ſaid above, that Mercury did change it ſelf into Sulphur, moyſture is the aliment or food of heat, and food transforms it ſelf into the thing which is fed. Therefore the definition of Elements ſhould rather ſute with theſe ſubſtances, ſince they are the laſt thing to be found, after the reſolution of the Compound, and that Elements are, <hi>Ea quae primo componunt Mixtum, &amp; in quae ultimo reſolvitur.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But becauſe the Elements are conſidered two wayes, either as they are parts which do conſtitute the Univerſe, or as they only compound Mixt Bodies; to accommodate our ſelves to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of expreſſion, we ſhall attribute unto them the name of Principles, in regard they are conſtitutive parts of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound; and ſhall reſerve the appellation of Elements, for thoſe great and vaſt Bodyes, which are the general Matrixes of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things.</p>

                              <p>CHymical Philoſophy doth admit for Principles of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, thoſe five ſubſtances whereof we have treated above, becauſe as it is a Science wholly ſenſal, it grounds its reaſons only upon what ſenſes do demonſtrate unto her: And becauſe having exactly anatomized a body natural, nothing is found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what may anſwer one of theſe five ſubſtances. But here may be a Queſtion moved of no ſmall difficulty, <hi>viz. Whether theſe five Subſtances, are Natural or Artificial Principles, and not rather Principles of Diſunion and deſtructive, than of Compoſition and Mixture?</hi> To this may be anſwered, that it is not a matter of ſmall difficulty, to know whether theſe Principles are natural, becauſe we do not ſee them ſevered from the Compound, by a natural corruption or putrefaction; and that Chymical ſeparation can only be performed by an artificial corruption cauſed by the help of the heat of fire: but if the buſineſſe be judiciouſly and narrowly examined, it will appear, that although theſe ſubſtances can only be extracted by the help of Chymical Art, they are notwithſtanding, meerly and purely Natural, ſince Art doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute nothing elſe but the Veſſels to contain and receive them. Whence Nature being deſtitute of theſe Veſſels, and we cannot without their help render thoſe ſubſtances palpable and viſible objects of the eye; it cannot ſeem ſtrange, that we ſhould not perceive theſe ſubſtances, in the natural corruption and ſolution of their Compounds: for Nature which is ſtill in action and buſie about productions, makes uſe of the ſaid ſubſtances, and applyes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170969:22"/>them to the generation of ſeveral other exiſtencies, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath very well obſerved, when he ſaith that, <hi>Corruptio unius eſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio alterius.</hi> Thence it is, that in the natural putrefaction of bodies, a certain ſmell for the moſt part offends our Noſtrils; a true token of the Air being impregnated with volatile ſpirits, which are Saline and Sulphureous; by which it appears, that the Mixt is radically diſſolved, and thus it is performed: The Salt is diſſolved by the help of the internal Phlegm or Water; and as the Salt is the bond of the two other Principles, ſo can they no longer ſubſiſt in their Mixt or Body, becauſe heat which accompanyes all putrefactions, doth ſubtilize and carry them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſo that there remains nothing but what is of earthlineſſe in the Compound. Therefore we do conclude, that although theſe Principles may not be made ſenſible and manifeſt, but by the Operations of Chymiſtry, it doth not debarre them notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding from being natural, becauſe if nature had not immixed them in all things, they could not indifferently be drawn from all bodies, as we daily ſee that they may; whence we inferre, that theſe ſubſtances are not extracted from the Mixt by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation, but by a meer natural ſeparation, aſſiſted by the heat of the Veſſels and the hand of the Artiſt: for all things cannot indifferently and immediately be transformed in the like and ſame things. Therefore it cannot be thought ſtrange, that other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances then the forementioned five, ſhould be extracted from Mixt Bodyes by Chymical Operations, when the way of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is altered, and proceeds by another way, then by the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Principles, ſuch as are the <hi>Quinteſſences, Arcana, Magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Specificks, Tinctures, Extracts, Faeculae, Balſoms, Flowers, Panacaea's</hi> and <hi>Elixirs,</hi> whereof <hi>Paracelſus</hi> treats at large, in his Books of <hi>Archidoxa;</hi> ſince all theſe ſeveral preparations take their vertues from the various mixture of the Principles, whereof we are to ſpeak in the following Sections, according to the order wherein they fall firſt under our ſenſes.

                                 <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Of Phlegm or Water.</head>
                              <p>THat inſipid liquor which commonly is called Water, hath by the Chymiſts the name of Phlegm given unto it, when it is ſeparated from all other Mixture; it is the firſt ſubſtance obvious to the eye, when the fire doth act upon any Mixt body; it appears firſt in the ſhape of a vapour, and by condenſation turns into liquor: Her preſence is as neceſſary as any other Principle in the compoſition of the Mixt: And we do not agree with the opinion of thoſe who hold it to be needleſſe, provided the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and harmony required in Natural bodyes be preſerved: for Phlegm is as the curb and rains of ſpirits, which dulls and allayes their ſharpneſſe, diſſolves the ſalt, and weakens its corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive acrimony, hindereth the inflamation of Sulphur, and bindes the Earth, and mixes it with the Salts; for as theſe two laſt Subſtances are brickle, crumbling and dry, ſo could they give but little firmneſſe and conſiſtency to the body without the help of this liquor: Thence it comes, that corruption and diſſolution are introduced by its abſence, which hath occaſioned ſome to call it <hi>the Principle of Deſtruction;</hi> for it eaſily vapours away, which is the cauſe that the Mixt cannot long ſubſiſt in the ſame ſtate and harmony, becauſe this Principle being part in the body, eaſily and at every hour exhaleth it ſelf and vapours away, which makes it obnoxious to the leaſt outward injuries, procured as much by internal as external cauſes. Therefore thoſe that do work about the preſervation of Mixts, make it their ſtudy to preſerve this Principle in the Compound; becauſe it is he that keepeth all the other linked together, as it evidently appears by the operations of our Art: It can endure ſeveral alterations, without changing its nature; for if ſometimes it turns it ſelf into vapours, they are notwithſtanding eſſentially nothing elſe but the very Phlegm it ſelf. And here you ſhall note, that vapours are of a different nature; ſome are meerly aqueous and Phlegmatick; others ſpirituous and Mercurial, others Sulphureous and Oyly; and laſtly, ſome participate of theſe three qualities together.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170969:23"/>It is moreover to be noted, that even the Salts, and Mineral and Metallick Earths, may be ſubtilized yet and turned into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours differing from the aforeſaid four qualities, yielding fixe and ponderous ſpirits, and flowers. Briefly, the Doctrine of fiery, aqueous, and aerial Meteors, may very well be related to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe vapours and exhalations: For we ſee that aqueous vapours are eaſily condenſed in water in the Limbecks, which the Spirituous or Oily are not, as requiring much more time and cooling; whence many conſequences may be drawn, tending to the uſe of Phyſick, and particularly in the cure of thoſe pains, which are thought to proceed from vapours and exhalations, and vulgarly are called Mereoriſms, or griping vapours of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle and Spleen: For aqueous vapours cannot cauſe ſo much diſtention, becauſe they are ſooner compreſſed and condenſed, then thoſe which proceed from the Spirits, Oyls, and mixt Salts. Now as too much Phlegm doth extinguiſh the natural heat, and ſlackens the body, and dulls all his functions: ſo the too ſmall proportion thereof, cauſeth as it were a burning and corroſion of it, whileſt the Sulphur and fixed Spirit or Salt becomes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant; an evident proof that the frame of mixt bodies doth only ſubſiſt by the harmony and juſt proportion of all its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. To conclude what we have ſaid of this Principle, you are to obſerve, that the Phlegme or wateriſh part of any Mixt, is ordinarily the fitteſt <hi>Menſtruum</hi> to extract the tincture and Extract thereof, becauſe it is endowed ſtill with ſome character of its Compound, and ſome Idea of its vertue and faculty: but chiefly becauſe it is for the moſt part accompanyed with the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Spirit of the Mixt, whereby it is rendred more capable eaſily to penetrate the ſame, and to extract its vertue, being partaker of a mixt nature of moſt ſubtile Sulphur and Mercury, which comes very neer to the Univerſal.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170969:23"/>Moyſture,</hi> but we ſhall keep the appellation of <hi>Spirit,</hi> as the moſt in uſe. Notwithſtanding, to avoyd error and miſtake in theſe vulgar names of Principles, and that the Reader ſhould not confound them with the appellations of Compounds; it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to inform him, that they have received ſuch names, only for the likeneſſe and correſpondency they have with thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances from which they are denominated: See therefore you do not miſtake Phlegm for Pituite, Mercury for Quick ſilver, and Sulphur for ordinary Brimſtone, which is an ingredient in the compoſition of Gun-powder, mixed with Saltpeter, nor Salt for that common Salt familiar to our Tables, and much leſſe Earth for ſuch a ſubſtance as is Bol-Armeny or <hi>Terra ſigillata,</hi> ſince all theſe are Bodies, compoſed of the ſame Principles, every one as we deſign by thoſe names. <hi>Spirit</hi> then is nothing elſe but that aerial, ſubtile, penetrating, active ſubſtance, which we draw out of the Mixt Body, by the help of fire; whence it is to be concluded, that this Principle in it ſelf is one, unmixt, and homogeneous, having taken its Idea from the character of its ſpecifick and particular Matrix, as we ſhall deduce hereafter more at large, when we ſpeak of the Elements, and their vertues, in the following Chapter. This ſubſtance of the Spirit is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, either as it compoſeth yet the Mixt, or as it is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it: Separated, it is very penetrating; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This ſame Spirit communicates ſeveral Noble qualities to the Phlegm; for it preſerves him from corruption, makes it penetrative, and endoweth him almoſt with a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>Now whileſt this Spirit remains in a due harmony, and doth not exceed the terms of his Office in mixt Bodies, it becomes to them very ſerviceable, hindering the encreaſe of excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious matters, and of all other ſubſtances which may prove con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary or hurtfull to the nature of the Compound, multiplying his ſubſtance, and ſtrengthning all his faculties, and that in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, Vegetables and Minerals. But if by the power of ſome other Agent, this Principle is forced to exceed the condition and conſtitution of the Mixt wherein it is, it alters the whole frame and oeconomy of its Compound, as we ſhall ſhew more at large, when we come to treat of the Principles of Deſtructives.</p>

                              <p>THis Principle, as well as the others, hath received ſeveral names; for it is called Oyl, Natural Fire, Light, Vital Fire, Balſom of Life and of Sulphur, and beſides, many other appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been given by the Sons of Art, with which we will not fill up this Section: According to our uſual cuſtom, we will content our ſelves, with examining the nature of the thing, leaving the nicetie of Names to the overcurious.</p>
                              <p>That ſubſtance then, which ſometimes we will call Oyl, ſometimes Sulphur, is the third in order of thoſe we extract by the artificial reſolution of the Compound; we give it this name becauſe it is an Oleagineous ſubſtance; which eaſily take fire, being of a combuſtible nature, by whoſe means alſo the Mixts are rendred ſuch. It is called Principle as well as the others, becauſe being ſeparated from the Compound, it is homogeneous in all his parts, as the other Principles are. This Subſtance is alſo conſidered two ſeveral wayes: For being looſened from the others, it ſwims above the Phlegm and Spirits, becauſe it is lighter and more aetherial; but if it be not abſolutely ſeparated from the Salt and the Earth, it will ſometimes precipitate it ſelf to the bottom, or ſwim in the middle, becauſe the Sulphur
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170969:24"/>ſupports and holds up the Earth and Salt, untill it be overcome by their weight; it receives not eaſily nor willingly the Salt, without being firſt joyned with the Spirit, or before the Salt be circulated with the Spirit, wherewith it hath a great ſympathy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then they eaſily receive the Sulphur together; a thing very well worth noting, ſince without this obſervation, no <hi>Panacaea</hi>'s, <hi>Magiſteries, Eſſences, Arcana</hi>'s, nor other moſt ſecret Remedies, which are unknown to vulgar Phyſicians, and <hi>Galenical</hi> Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries, can be made: no more then theſe can give a reaſon of the nobleſt natural effects; becauſe for the moſt part they aſſign them to the four firſt or primary Qualities.</p>
                              <p>This Sulphur is of the matter of thoſe fiery Meteors, which are kindled in the ſeveral Regions of the Air, and are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found in the Cavities of the earth, and chiefly in thoſe places, where Minerals and Metals are generated; it reſiſts to Cold, and never congeals, being the Principle of Heat; it never ſuffers corruption, preſerves from it thoſe things which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed in it, preventing the penetration of Air, it ſweetens the acrimony of Salt, by whoſe help it is fixed and coagulated; doth ſo powerfully blunt the ſharpneſſe of Spirits, that the moſt ſtrong Waters have no power over it, nor thoſe Bodies where it abounds. His Office is, to binde and allay the Earth which is but duſt, with the Salt in the frame of Mixt Bodies: It cauſes alſo the ſtrict union of the other Principles, moderating the too great dryneſs of Salt, and fluidity of Spirit, and finally by his means, theſe three Principles grow into a viſcuous compact ſubſtance, which often times hardens afterwards, by the mixture of the Earth and Phlegm.</p>

                              <p>THe Phlegm, Spirit, and Sulphur, are volatile Principles flying from the Fire, which makes them aſcend, and ſublimate into vapours; whence it followeth, that they were unable to endure the Mixt with a requiſite ſolidity for its duration, unleſs there were ſome other fixt and permanent ſubſtances joyned unto
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170969:25"/>it; of which we finde two wholly differing from the others in the laſt diſſolution of Bodies. The firſt is a plain and unmixt Earth, without any remarkable quality, except it be drineſs and heavineſs: The ſecond is a Subſtance; which reſiſts fire, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves in water, known to Chymiſts by the name of <hi>Salt.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Theſe two ſubſtances, which are as it were the baſis and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Mixt, though confounded by the action of fire, are notwithſtanding two ſeveral Principles in which are to be found ſuch eſſential differences, that there is between them no Analogy. The ſalt doth manifeſt it ſelf by his qualities, which are as numberleſs as efficatious and powerfull, much more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compare then the Earth, which is almoſt without action or vertue.</p>
                              <p>The Salt being exactly ſevered from the other Principles, offers it ſelf to our ſenſes in a drie, crumbling, and brickle body, eaſily reduced to powder, a certain ſign of his external drought; but it is endowed alſo of an internal moyſture, witneſs its fuſibility; it is fixt, and incombuſtible, reſiſting to fire, wherein it growes purer, ſuffereth no putrefaction, and is (as it were) eternal, being capable to preſerve it ſelf without alteration. This ſubſtance is thought by ſome, to be the firſt ſubject and cauſe of all ſavours, as the Sulphur of odours, and Mercury of colours; but we ſhall refute this Aſſertion, when we come to handle this Subject hereafter.</p>
                              <p>Salt is eaſily diſſolved in moyſture, and being diſſolved bears up the Sulphur, and joyns it to it ſelf by the means of the Spirit. The uſefulneſs of it is very great; for it hinders fire from conſuming haſtily the Oyl; which is the cauſe that floated Wood doth not yield a long flame, being deprived of the greateſt part of its Salt: It is ſalt which makes the earth fruitfull, being with the Oyl, inſtead of a vital Balſom to Vegetables; and thence it comes, that Grounds too much waſhed with rain, loſe their fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility: It conduceth alſo to the generation of Animals, and hardens Minerals alſo, and giveth them their conſiſtency: But you are to note, that all theſe effects do only follow, when it is diſpenſed in Bodies, with a juſt proportion; for if it exceeds, generation and encreaſe are thereby hindered, becauſe it corrodes and deſtroyes with his acrimony, whatſoever the other ſubſtances can produce.</p>

                              <p>But that you may not be deceived by the ambiguity of the word <hi>Salt,</hi> you are to know, that there is a certain Central Salt, radical Principle of all things, which is the firſt body wherewith the Univerſal Spirit cloſeth it ſelf, and contains the other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; ſome have called it <hi>Hermetical Salt,</hi> becauſe, ſay they, <hi>Hermes</hi> was the firſt that ſpoke of it: but it may be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and lawfully called the <hi>Hermaphroditical Salt,</hi> becauſe it participates of all natures, and is indifferently inclined to all. This Salt is the fundamental ground of all Nature, being the Center where all her vertues do meet, and the true ſeeds of all things, being nothing elſe, but a congealed, well digeſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted Salt: The truth of which evidently appears in this, that if you boyl in water any Seed whatſoever, it becomes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately barren; becauſe this ſeminal vertue conſiſts in a very ſubtile Salt, which diſſolves and vaniſhes in the water; whence we learn, that Nature beginneth the production of all things by a central and radical Salt, which ſhe extracts out of the Univerſal Spirit. The difference between theſe two Salts is, that the firſt breeds the other in the Mixt, and that the <hi>Hermaphroditical</hi> Salt is ever a Principle of Life, and the other proves ſometimes a Principle of Death. But becauſe we are to treat hereunder, of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of death and deſtruction, we ſhall not inſiſt in theſe Sections upon the effects of either, becauſe the knowledge of Contraries being the ſame, they ſhall be more illuſtrated when oppoſed one to another.</p>

Let us conſider at preſent, the uſefulneſs of this ſubſtance, very neceſſary in the Compound of the body, ſince it is by her means that it receives firmneſs and conſiſtency: For being united to the Salt, it cauſes preſently the corporeity, and conſequently, the continuity of the parts: Mixt with the Oyl or Sulphur, it cauſes tenacity, viſcoſity, and lent or, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſlowneſs in motion; it yields then with Salt, hardneſs and firmneſs; for as Salt is of a brickle and crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling nature, and eaſily reduced to duſt, it could not intimately be united to the earth, to give it a ſolidity, but by the help of moyſt and liquid ſubſtances. The inconveniencies of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple are manifeſted in this, that the Mixt requireth abundance of the other ſubſtances: For when Earth doth predominate, it makes the body heavy, ſlow, cold and ſtupid, according to the nature of Compoſites, wherein it doth abound.</p>
                              <p>But you ſhall notwithſtanding take notice, by the By, that it is not the ſole Earth which cauſeth the heavineſs of the body, as thoſe Philoſophers do aſſert, who are little acquainted with our handy-work: For we finde more Earth in a pound of Cork after its reſolution, though it be a very light body, then in three or four of <hi>Box</hi> and <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> which are ſo heavy, that (againſt the nature of other Woods) they can ſcarce hold above water: Whence we muſt of neceſſity conclude, that the greateſt heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and weight of Bodies, proceeds of Salt and Spirits aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in theſe Woods, whereof Cork is deprived. It is alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally ſeen, that a Glaſs filled with Spirit of Vitriol, or ſome other ſharp Spirit well rectified, ſhall outweigh two or three Glaſſes of the ſame bigneſs, filled with water, or any other like Liquor. I know it will be objected againſt this Experiment, that the heavineſs of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> proceeds from the compactedneſs of its ſubſtance, almoſt impenetrable to Air, and that the lightneſs of Cork doth proceed from the great quantity of big and large pores it hath, which are filled with that light Element, and cauſe it to ſwim above water, contrarily to <hi>Box</hi> and <hi>Guaiacum.</hi> But
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170969:26"/>this Anſwer is not fully ſatisfactory; for if levity and heavineſs are cauſed by rarefaction and condenſation, it will follow thence, that thoſe many pores in Cork, muſt proceed from the abundance of earth in it, and the defect of the other Principles; and hence it will be concluded neceſſarily, that Earth is porous of it ſelf; and ſecondly, that it cauſeth poroſity in Bodies: For the Axiom is true, <hi>Nihil dat quod non habet; &amp;, Propter quod unumquodque eſt tale, illud eſt magis tale,</hi> ſay the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> or Ambulatory Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers; and ſo ſhall they be forced to aſſert by their own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though contradictory to their Maxims, that Earth cauſeth not only the levity of Mixts, but that it is alſo light of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which in their Philoſophy ſhould be a Monſter: and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts alſo to experience; for of all the Principles, when they are duely and according to Art ſeparated one from the other, none is heavyer then the Earth, which ever ſubſideth in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Glaſs, when they are mixt together.</p>
                              <p>To come out of this Labyrinth, a higher Philoſophy is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and fair <hi>Ariadne,</hi> which is <hi>Nature</hi> it ſelf, muſt be courted, to obtain this Clue, and finde the iſſue of its winding paths; which if we can happily attain to, we ſhall be taught by the operations of Chymiſtry, that there is two ſorts of levity and heavineſs, the one internal, the other external; the one found in the Principles, whileſt they yet compound the Mixt, the other when they are ſeparated aſunder.</p>

                              <p>THE difference which <hi>Peripateticks</hi> make between Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and Element, is, as they ſay, that Principles can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take one anothers nature, neither be metamorphoſed or tranſmuted the one into the other; but that Elements are Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170969:27"/>which of themſelves are compounded of Principles, and do compound the Mixts afterwards at their turns, and ſo theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances can eaſily paſs one into anothers nature; the truth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſhall examine hereafter. But in <hi>Hermetical Philoſophy,</hi> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are taken for thoſe four great Bodies, which are as it were the Matrixes, containing in themſelves, the vertues, ſeeds, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and Idea's imparted to them by the Univerſal Spirit. But before we enter into this kinde of Philoſophy, after we have ſpoken in the foregoing Chapter of the nature of Principles, we muſt now treat in this of Elements; where we will firſt examine, what reaſon the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> have to ſay, that Mixt Bodies are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of thoſe Elements, and whether there are not more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances found in their Diſſolutions, then thoſe which their Books make mention of.</p>
                              <p>They ſay, that when Wood is burned in the Fire, four ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances do manifeſtly occur to the ſenſes, and do aſſure us, that theſe are the four Elements, which did conſtitute the Mixt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was deſtroyed by the fire. Let us examine, whether they have diſcovered all, and left no occaſion unto us of farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
                              <p>Their reaſons are grounded upon the following experience: The four Elements, ſay they, are made manifeſt to our ſenſes, when the Wood comes to be examined and conſumed by Fire; for the Flame repreſents the Fire, the Smoak Air, the Moyſture iſſuing from the ends of the Wood Water, and the Aſhes Earth; whence they draw this conſequence, That ſince we ſee but thoſe four ſubſtances, there was none other that could conſtitute the Compound. But, though we grant thoſe four to be all what can appear in ſo groſs an operation, yet, if we will proceed with more Art and exactneſs, we ſhall not want to finde ſomething more in it: For if you take the pains to encloſe ſhreds or filings of Wood in a well luted Retort, and fit a capacious Recipient to it, and give a graduate and regular fire, you ſhall diſcover two ſubſtances, which without this Art cannot fall under our ſenſes, and this is the Apple of Diſcord between <hi>Peripatetical</hi> and <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical</hi> Philoſophers: Which before I proceed further, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reconcile. To this end, we grant to both Parties, that Principles and Elements, are found in all Mixts; but let us
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170969:27"/>ſee how. When the firſt ſay, that the Smoak in burning Wood repreſents the Air, we ſay they are in the right, for it is only by way of Analogy and ſimilitude, that this Smoak can obtain the denomination of Air; For it is not really Air, ſince experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſheweth us, that this ſmoak impriſoned in a Recipient, hath qualities very much differing from that of Air; whence we inferr, it can be called Air, only by Analogy. And this is the point in which both do differ, concerning this ſubſtance, that the <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks</hi> call it <hi>Air,</hi> and Chymiſts <hi>Mercury:</hi> Let them diſpute of the words, provided we do agree in the thing it ſelf.</p>
                              <p>We come now to the other Element of <hi>Peripateticks, viz.</hi> Fire, and the other Principle of Chymiſters, Sulphury, which we are to examine, and ſee in what they agree, and wherein they differ. The firſt ſay, that in the action of Fire preying upon Wood, its action is manifeſt to the ſenſes. But our anſwer to this ſenſible experiment is, that whatſoever deſtroyes the Mixt, cannot be a conſtitutive Principle of it, but rather a Principle of deſtruction: If they return, That no fire is actually in the Mixt, but only po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially: therein we will cloſe with them, and reconcile them with the Chymiſts, who name their Sulphur that potential fire of <hi>Peripateticks.</hi> To end then their Controverſie, I ſay, that the fire which we ſee to iſſue out of burning Wood, is nothing elſe but the Sulphur of Wood actuated; for the actuating of Sulphur doth conſiſt in its inflamation. As for the Aſhes which they will have to be the Element of Earth; that Salt which by waſhings and Elixivation is extracted out of them, ſhould ſufficiently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade theſe Philoſophers, that the Chymiſts are as well, if not better, grounded in eſtabliſhing the number of their Principles.</p>
                              <p>The number then of Principles and Elements which compound Mixt Bodies, being thus cleared, it remains for us to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Elements, both as to their number and propriety, before we ſpeak of them ſeverally, as alſo of their Matrixes and Fruits.</p>
                              <p>It is a thing to be wondred at, that the Sectators of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſhould not yet ſince ſo long a time that his Writings and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy are in credit, have determined the number of Elements: For ſome amongſt them with great reaſon do affirm, that there is no Elementary Fire; I ſay, with reaſon, if it be underſtood in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170969:28"/>their own ſenſe: for, to what purpoſe is it to admit an Element of Fire under the ſphere of the Moon, ſince we aſſign to it no other uſe then to enter in the Compound of Mixt Bodies; and that, beſides that Element ſo placed, is at too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the place where Mixts are generated, we have found that the fire in them is nothing elſe but their Sulphur: therefore I do conclude here, with <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> that there is no other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary fire, but the Heaven it ſelf, and its light.</p>
                              <p>As touching the general proprieties of Elements, two Quaeries uſe to be made on them: The firſt, If they are pure; the ſecond, If they are tranſmutable one into the other. Concerning their purity, I anſwer, that if they were ſuch, they ſhould prove of no uſe; for a pure Earth were barren, ſince it ſhould have in it ſelf no ſeeds of procreation and fruitfulneſs; and the brine of the Sea, and ſeveral qualities of the Air, ſufficiently confirm this Aſſertion. But as concerning their mutual tranſmutation of one into the other, it is not ſo eaſily performed as vulgar Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers do imagine, though we cannot ſay it to be abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: For they teach, that Earth is changed into Water, Water into Air, Air into Fire, and finally that Fire by another tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion returns into Earth: Becauſe, although Earth and Water do ſometimes aſſume and take the ſhape and form of Exhalations, yet theſe vapours are alwayes eſſentially Water or Earth, as it is made plain by their re-aſſuming their firſt nature. This change then cannot happen, unleſs ſuch or ſuch Element being totally ſpiritualized, comes to loſe its Elementary Idea, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united afterwards to the Univerſal Spirit, who might then give him the Idea of another Element, whoſe body he might have, by the character imprinted by the Matrix.</p>
                              <p>For this reaſon do Chymiſts aſſign two natures to Elements, in their deſcription of them; <hi>viz.</hi> the one Spiritual, the other Corporal; the vertue of the one being hidden in the boſom of the other. Hence it comes, that when they will have any thing to act efficaciouſly, they endeavour as much as in them lies, to deveſt it from its Body, and ſpiritualize it: For as Nature cannot communicate its. Treaſures unto us, but under the ſhade of Bodies, ſo can we do no more then to deveſt them by the help of Art from the groſſeſt and moſt material part of that Body, to apply
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170969:28"/>to our uſes: for if we urge them, and ſpiritualize too much, ſo as that they ſhould flye from our ſight and contact, then do they loſe their bodily Idea and character, and return again to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Spirit, to re-aſſume after ſome ſpace of time their firſt Idea, or ſome other differing from it, by the character and Idea of ſuch or ſuch a Matrix, incloſed in ſuch or ſuch part of ſuch or ſuch Element.</p>
                              <p>Theſe are the true effects of Elements, which are, as we have ſaid, to corporifie or identifie the Univerſal Spirit, by the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ferments contained in their particular Matrixes, and to give it thoſe characters which they had imprinted in themſelves; for, as we have ſaid, this Spirit is undetermined to all things, and may be made all in all. This happens, becauſe Nature is never idle, but perpetually in action; and as it is a finited eſſence, ſo can it neither create or annihilate any other, becauſe ſuch an act be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to an infinite power. But this matter being of too large an extent to be treated of here, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>SInce all things tend to their Center, and place of their natural reſt, it is a manifeſt ſign that they are thereunto inclined and drawn, by a natural vertue, hidden under the ſhade of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; this vertue can be nothing elſe, but that Magnetick faculty wherewith each Element is endowed, to draw its like to it ſelf, and repell its contrary: For as the Load-ſtone attracts the Iron of one ſide, and rejects it of the other, the Elements do likewiſe by a like power attract thoſe things which correſpond with their nature, and repell and drive away from them, thoſe that be of a different: ſince then fire aſcends, it is not to be doubted but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170969:29"/>that this effect doth proceed from a tendency it hath to its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral place, which is Elementary Fire, where it is carryed by its own proper ſpirit, when it forſakes the commerce of the other Elements.</p>
                              <p>To underſtand well this Doctrine, it is firſt to be known, that the Element of Fire is not encloſed under the ſphere of the Moon, as we have already hinted above, and that conſequently no other Fire can be admitted, then the <hi>Aether</hi> or Heaven it ſelf, which hath its Matrixes and fruits, as the other Elements. For that great number of Stars which we ſee moving in that vaſt Element, are nothing elſe but particular Wombs or Matrixes, where the Univerſal Spirit takes a very perfect Idea, before it deſcends to incorporate it ſelf in the Matrixes of the other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and thence may be illuſtrated the ſenſe and meaning of that Axiom of the <hi>Great-Hermes,</hi> which many look upon as a <hi>Chimaera;</hi> that, <hi>Nihil eſt inferius, quod non ſit ſuperius &amp; vice verſâ;</hi> and that opinion of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> who doth affirm, That every thing hath its peculiar Heaven and <hi>Aſtrum:</hi> For to ſpeak true, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of all ſublunar things cometh from Heaven, by the means of that Spirit whereof we have already ſo much ſpoken. <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi> names the knowledge of this Doctrine, <hi>Pyromancy,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he treats of the <hi>Theory of Diſeaſes;</hi> for we ſee that Elements are as it were the Receptacles and Domicils of all thoſe things that are endowed with an intellectual, ſenſitive, or vegetative knowledge, or alſo Mineral, which ſome do call the fruits of Elements: And according to that Doctrine, it is not to be doubted, that as the Heavens are moſt perfect and ſpiritual, ſo they are the Manſion and Receptacle of thoſe ſpiritual and perfect ſubſtances which are called Intelligences.</p>
                              <p>But you muſt note, that when I have ſaid, that Fire in its aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent doth forſake the commerce of others Elements, that I have ſo ſpoken, only becauſe the viſible Fire which we uſe on our Hearths, is nothing elſe but a Meteor or Body imperfectly mixt of ſome Elements or Principles, wherein Fire or Sulphur are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, and its flame an oleagineous and ſulphureous ſmoak kindled; and when fire is ſpiritualized by that forſaking, it never ceaſeth till it hath returned to its natural place, which of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity muſt be above, and beyond the Air, ſince we ſee it in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170969:29"/>Air it ſelf in a perpetual action, as willing to forſake it. It is alſo by the means of this fire, which is ſtill aſpiring to its Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the Clouds, which are hot and moyſt Vapours, or Meteors, compounded of Fire and Water, aſcend to the ſecond or middle Region of the Air, where the fire forſaking the water to aſcend ſtill higher, and ſo this Water finding it ſelf deſtituted of the Fire, which did bear it up in the Form of a Vapour, is forced to fall back in the form and ſubſtance of <hi>rain.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And here you are to note that Circulation, which Nature makes by the means of that Univerſal Spirit, already deſcribed; for as its power is limited, and that ſhe can, neither create nor produce any new thing, ſo can ſhe neither create nor annihilate any ſubſtance already created; as for Example, The continual Influxes of Heaven and its Starres, do inceſſantly produce the Fire or Spiritual Light, which beginneth firſt to embody it ſelf in the Air, where it takes the Idea of <hi>Hermaphroditical</hi> Salt, which thence falls in the waters and upon the earth, where it takes a body, either Mineral, Vegetable, or Animal, by the character and efficacy of ſome particular Matrix, imprinted in it by the action of its ferment; And when this body comes to be diſſolved by the means of ſome potent Agent, its Sulphur, Fire or Light corporified is ſo depurated, that the Starrs attract it for their food; for the Stars, (as we ſuppoſe) are nothing elſe but a Fire, a Sulphur, or ſome moſt pure Light actuated: Not unlike the link of a Lamp, which once being lighted, doth continually attract the Oyl to feed its flame: ſo that the Starrs in the ſame manner attract this fire, which is depurated by that action, and ſpiritualize it anew, to precipitate again by their kinde influency, and reſtore it to the Air, the Water, and the Earth, to corporifie it, or give it a body again: Thus you ſee nothing is loſt in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which maintains its great work, and wheel, by theſe two principal actions, <hi>viz.</hi> By ſpiritualizing to corporifie, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porifying to ſpiritualize, as we have already ſaid; and theſe are as two Ladders, whereby the heavenly influences deſcend down, and re-aſcend again from the lower parts: for the Heavenly vertues ſhould not be ſo durable, and would daily decay, by reaſon of the perpetual Conflux of ſo many productive ſubſtances, without this conſtant Circulation; unleſs that without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170969:30"/>we would admit a perpetual creation and deſtruction of ſublunary ſubſtances, which could not be without a Miracle, and being a thing of daily courſe, might be called a miracle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out miracle, and ſo imply a manifeſt contradiction: What Spring do you think could ſupply the matter which feeds thoſe vaſt <hi>Aetnean</hi> flames, which have laſted already ſo many Ages, were it not for this Circulation of Nature? And what could ſince ſo many years entertain the ſtreaming ſources of thoſe mineral, hot, and acid Fountains which the World doth afford in ſo many places, unleſs it were by the help of this wonderfull Ladder, and concatenation of Earth and Heaven: Therefore it muſt not be held totally impoſſible to make a Body turn wholly into Spirit, and reduce that Spirit again to Body; for you know, that Art applying Actives to Paſſives, may in a very ſhort time perform that, which Nature muſt be long buſied about: And becauſe that artificial Circulation which was performed in an ancient Sepulcher ſound out at <hi>Padua,</hi> doth not ill repreſent that Natural Circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Circulation of Nature, whereof we have ſpoken, it will not be amiſs to inſert here in ſew words the hiſtory of it; <hi>Appianus</hi> in his Books of Antiquities, relates it thus: That in the Town of <hi>Padua</hi> was diſcovered a very ancient Monument, wherein, being opened, a burning Lamp was found, which had been there kindled many Ages before, as by the Inſcriptions of it did appear. This fire could not poſſibly be maintained, but by Circulation, and ſo it is eaſie to conjecture how it was done; <hi>viz.</hi> The Oyl ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualized by the heat of the burning and kindled Taper, did condenſe it ſelf at the top, and ſo fall again into the ſame place whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nce it had been elevated. The Taper likely was made of Gold, <hi>Talcum,</hi> or <hi>Alumen Plumeum,</hi> which are incombuſtible; and the Urn was ſo exactly cloſed, that the leaſt particle of Oleagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous vapours could not breathe out.</p>

                              <p>PHiloſophers have been long in doubt, whether there was an Element of <hi>Air,</hi> and whether that ſpace wherein Animals do move and live, was not voyd of all ſubſtance; but the invention
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170969:30"/>and uſe of Bellowes, and the neceſſity of reſpiration, have at laſt aboliſht this error. Therefore, there is no debate or difference between <hi>Chymiſt</hi> and <hi>Peripateticks</hi> at preſent, concerning the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency and place of this Element; but they agree not amongſt themſelves concerning its uſe in Nature: for theſe laſt do make the Air to bear a part in the compoſition of Mixt Bodies, which the former utterly reject and deny, becauſe it never falls under their ſenſes, in the laſt reſolution of the Compound. The chief uſe which Chymiſts do aſſign to this Element, is, that it ſerves as Matrix to the Univerſal Spirit, which doth begin in it to take ſome bodily Idea, before it be wholly corporified in the Elements of Water and Earth, who produce Mixt Bodies, that are as fruits of the ſaid Elements. And becauſe we ſee no Element which doth not bear and produce its fruits, ſome have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to affirm, that Birds were the fruits of the Air. But this opinion is wrong and erroneous; for although theſe Birds be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile, and for the moſt part abide in the Air, yet can they not be deprived of Commerce with the Earth either for the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of generation or food: they that maintain Meteors to be the right fruits of the Air, are much more in the right, ſince they take in it their true Meteoric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>Another queſtion may be yet ſtarted, touching the uſe of reſpiration or breathing in Animals: Whether that Air which they draw in their breathing, hath any other end but meerly to refreſh them, as the ordinary Philoſophers do give out, only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon their Teachers words, without any induſtrious enquiry touching the truth of it, and contenting themſelves to quote their Authority, as the ſum and ground of all reaſons: But thoſe that look more narrowly into the nature of things, ſay, that there is another much more excellent and neceſſary uſe thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> to attract the Univerſal Spirit, which by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This appears even in the Plants, though very obſcurely: for although they be deprived of Lungs, or any other material Inſtrument, for the performance of reſpiration; yet have they ſomething Analogous to it, which is their Magnetiſme, by which they draw that Spirit reſiding in the Air, without which they could not perform their natural Operations, as to

                              <p>THE moſt learned and perſpicacious Philoſophers amongſt the Ancients, have been of opinion, that Water was the firſt Principle of all things; becauſe it could in their apprehenſion, by its rarefaction or condenſation, produce the other Elements. But as we have heretofore declared this mutual change to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, ſo muſt we have our recourſe to another way of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.

The Water then is the ſecond gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Matrix, where the Univerſal Spirit takes the Idea of Salt, communicated by the Air, which did receive it from the Light, and the Heavens, for the production of all ſublunary things. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> calls the knowledge of this Philoſophy of Water, <hi>Hydromancy.</hi>

                              <p>IN the laſt Section of the foregoing Chapter, we have ſpoken of the Earth, as a Principle partly conſtituting the mixture of the body, and found after its laſt reſolution; but in this Section we treat of it, as of the fourth and laſt Elem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>The Earth in this reſpect is, as it were, the Center of the World, in which all its vertues, proprieties and faculties are united; it ſeemeth even that all the other Elements were created for the uſe and benefit of the Earth, for all what is in them more precious, ſeemeth to be intended for its ſervice. Thus the Orbs of Heaven are inceſſantly whirled about, to ſupply all the parts of it with vital ſpirit, and for the maintaining as it were, and recruiting the daily expences of its Family: The Air is in a perpetual motion, to penetrate her deepeſt bowels, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap> that to the ſame end, <hi>viz.</hi> to furniſh her with the ſame vital ſpirit; and the Water is never at reſt, running continually to communicate to her that which the Air hath beſtowed upon him: So that all the World ſeemeth to be concerned for the Earth, and the Earth only for her Fruits, which are her Children, ſhe being the Mother of all things. It ſeemeth even that the Univerſal Spirit, loves the Earth above any other of the Elements, ſince it deſcends from the higheſt part of Heaven, where it is in its exaltation, to corporifie it ſelf, or take a bodily ſhape here on Earth. Now the firſt Body which the Univerſal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth take, is that of <hi>Hermaphroditical Salt,</hi> whereof we have ſpoken above, which contains generally in it ſelf all the Principles of life: it is not deprived of Sulphur nor Mercury, for it is the ſeed of all things, which takes afterwards a body, and the Idea or <hi>taliety</hi> of Mixts, by help of the characters of particular Matrixes or Wombs, incloſed in the body of this great Element: If it meets with a Vitriolick Matrix, it turns it ſelf to Vitriol; if with Sulphur, it becomes Sulphur, and ſo of the reſt, and that by the vertue and efficacy of ſeveral natural ſermentations: In a Vegetable Matrix, it becomes Plant; in a Mineral, Stone, Mineral, Metal; in an Animal, whether living or not living, it produces an Animal, as it is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170969:32"/>daily ſeen in the generation of ſuch creatures as are produced by the corruption of ſome Animal, or other Mixt; as for Example, Bees generated out of young Bulls fleſh, and Worms out of the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſeveral Fruits: Now as there are a great many differences of Mixts, ſo is there a great variety of particular Matrixes, which often cauſeth a tranſplantation in all things; but this matter belongeth rather to <hi>Chymical Philoſophy</hi> then to this place, where having no time to particularize, we do treat of things only in a general way. The knowledge of that part of Philoſophy which concerns this Element and its fruits, is called <hi>Geomancy.</hi> By it we are made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of knowing the operations of Nature, both in its very bowels and the ſurface: Her fruits are the Animals, Vegetables and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; and if theſe Mixts are compoſed of the pureſt vital Principles, then according to their proper nature and condition, will they be laſting, and will attain the end of their natural predeſtination (or deſtiny) if ſome external and occaſional cauſe doth not interrupt that progreſs, and ſtop them in their Career: But when <hi>Chance</hi> (or <hi>Fortune</hi>) mixes in their firſt Compoſition or Nouriſhment, any of the Principles of Death or Deſtruction, they cannot long ſubſiſt, neither end their intended courſe by Nature; becauſe theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtical <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170969:33"/>by a ſhort Diſcourſe upon theſe Principles, although to ſpeak properly, they ſhould not be called by this name; for it is proper to the nature of Principles ever to compound or generate, but never to deſtroy.</p>
                              <p>We have ſhewed heretofore, that Principles may be conſidered three ſeveral wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> Either before the compoſition of the Mixt, or in the ſtate of its compoſition, or finally after diſſolution and deſtruction: We may ſay the ſame here touching the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Death, which we have already ſaid in another place concerning the <hi>Principles of Life.</hi> But becauſe Contraries oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed one to the other, are better apprehended and illuſtrated, we ſhall ſay ſomething again concerning the Principles of Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the compoſition of the Mixt, that we may the better come to the knowledge of the Principles of Death, when we ſhall ſpeak of it in the third Section; for we ſhall referre our ſelves so ſpeak of their effects, being already corporified or embodyed in Mixts, when we come to treat of <hi>Purity and Impurity.</hi>

                              <p>WE have often ſaid above, that the Univerſal Spirit being indifferent to be made all things, is undetermined to any particular ſubject, unleſs by the character of particular Matrixes; and becauſe each Element is filled with theſe particular Matrixes or Wombs, as we have already proved, each Element doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſomething of his own for the perfection of its Compoſite. The Heaven doth by the aſſiſtance of his Stars, communicate unto it her heavenly, ſpiritual, and inviſible vertue, which deſcends firſt into the Air, where it beginneth to aſſume a kinde of body; the Air ſends it into the Water or the Earth, where this coeleſtial vertue and influence beginneth to operate more materially, and aſſociate it ſelf to matter, thereby to frame a body to it ſelf, by means of thoſe various natural fermentations which are the cauſe of alteration in ſublunary things: becauſe this Spirit is the true Agent, and the true efficient internal cauſe of theſe fermentations performed in the Matter, which of it ſelf is meerly paſſive, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170969:33"/>the <hi>Archeus</hi> or director general of it: For when it is Mixt and united to the body, which clotheth it as it were, or involves it under its rinde, it can neither produce nor manifeſt thoſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full effects which it hides and conceals, being then as it were fettered and impriſoned; and ſhall never be able to exerciſe or ſhew his vittues, unleſs it be firſt diſintangled of its corporeity, and groſſeneſs of the matter; and this is the main point upon which Chymiſtry beſtowes ſo much labour, care and ſtudy, to bring unto light thoſe lovely Truths, which this p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                                    <desc>••</desc>
                                 </gap>t of natural knowledge doth contain.</p>
                              <p>Now as this Univerſal Spirit is the firſt Principle of all things, and that all things are produced by it, and return into the ſame, it is evident, that it muſt by neceſſity prove alſo the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or Original of death in all things, which doth imply no contradiction, ſince it is done and underſtood in ſeveral reſpects; for as the variety of Compounds in Nature, doth require for its maintenance a variety of ſubſtances: There is alſo a variety of Matrixes or Wombs in the Elements, to attend the fabrick of thoſe various ſubſtances, and thence it is that what doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times advance the life of one, is the deſtruction and death of the other; as for Example: A corroſive Principle will be the death of a ſweet Mixt; and contrary wiſe, a ſweet Principle the death of a corroſive, by taking away its acrimony and ſharpneſs, which did conſtitute its eſtence and differency.</p>
                              <p>But to ſpeak ſtrictly and properly, it appears, that this firſt Principle, thus and thus Ideified, cannot be ſaid to be a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Life or Death: This expreſſion can hold but in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective conſideration, and as it relates to this or that Compound; but as the moſt part of ſweet things do contribute to the ſervice and preſervation of Mankind, becauſe they have ſome correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with his taſte, and participate more of ſubſtances analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous to his Nature and Conſtitution: Hence it comes to paſs, that when the Univerſal Spirit hath received this ſtamp or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, it takes the denomination of <hi>Principle of Life;</hi> as to the contrary that of <hi>Death,</hi> if it be ſtampt with a corroſive Idea, which not only prejudiceth to the actions of man, but corrupts alſo thoſe of ſuch Mixts and Subſtances as ſerve for his daily food and ſubſiſtance.</p>
                              <pb n="46" facs="tcp:170969:34"/>
                              <p>So when the Air is filled with Arſenical vapours, and Realga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick and Corroſive Influences, which by reaſon of the neceſſary uſe of reſpiration, are often the cauſe of great mortality amongſt Mankinde; yet conſidering that thoſe deſtructive ſpirits are not influenced to that end, and that their ill effects, as to Man, are only accidental; ſo can they not properly be called Principles of Death, ſince they are diſpenſed here below by the Care of Nature, for the generation and propagation of Arſenical Subſtances, Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, and other corroſive mixt Compounds, which are no eſs a part of the World then Man it ſelf, and are deſtinated to a better end, by the hand of the all-wiſe Maſter and Creator of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, then is known unto moſt of us; for we ſee that Nature and Art can ſo order and prepare theſe Mixts, as to make them fit and ſerviceable for the uſe of Man: We muſt not therefore preſently call Nature a Step-mother to us, ſince God hath endowed us with the skill and means, to avoid theſe evil and malignant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencies. To accommodate our ſelves then, to the vulgar way of expreſſion, we ſhall ſay, that the Principles of Life, before the Compoſition of the Mixt, are nothing elſe but the Univerſal Spirit, impregnated with the Idea of favourable and amicable Principles to our Nature, and poſſeſſing in the Center of its <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphroditical Salt,</hi> a moderate Sulphur, a temperate Mercury, and a ſweet Salt: as to the contrary, the Principles of Death are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but this ſame Spirit, having in it the ſame <hi>Hermaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditical Salt</hi> mixt with a ſharp Sulphur, a biting Mercury, and a corroſive Salt, as we ſhall more fully declare in the following Section.</p>

                              <p>I Muſt, before I do proceed further, repeat once more here, that when we call theſe, <hi>Principles againſt Nature,</hi> we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not Nature in a general term; but only humane Nature: becauſe it happens often, that what is Poyſon to one <hi>ſpecies,</hi> ſhall be nouriſhment to the other: ſo doth Hen-bane pleaſe to Sterns, which feed upon it; and killeth Man.</p>
                              <pb n="47" facs="tcp:170969:34"/>
                              <p>This ground being layd, I ſay, that all heat, or rather all hot, corroſive, biting, ſharp ſubſtance, which deſtroyes and conſumes, is ſuch, becauſe it contains in it ſelf a Sulphur againſt Nature; and that from this Sulphur it is, that as from their Spring, do flow all the vertues and proprietyes of the Mixt, where that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Sulphur is predominant: for if Life doth flow from a ſweet, natural and vital Sulphur, and that it receives a long preſervation by the eſſential proprietyes of this Sulphur, it muſt neceſſarily be concluded, that death and deſtruction muſt follow that Sulphur which is of an oppoſite nature unto it; and all Arſenicks, Realgar, Auripigment, or Lead-oar, Sandarack, and all other venoms of a hot, fiery nature, whether <hi>celeſtial, aerial, watery, terreſtrial,</hi> all theſe Poyſons, I ſay, are ſuch by their very actions, and ſole propriety of this Sulphur againſt Nature.</p>
                              <p>It is not our deſign to ſpeak here of thoſe Principles which are enemies and contrary to humane nature when they are already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated, and do compoſe ſome of the venemous Mixts, becauſe we referre our ſelves to treat of it in the Book following; we ſhall only ſpeak of theſe Principles here, as they are yet <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> &amp; flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Stars; by the mediation of the Univerſal Spirit, and as this Principle is ſingle in this reſpect, ſo hath it received theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and different denominations: for as we have already ſaid, that the Sulphur, which is heat, cannot be without Mercury, that is to ſay, <hi>moyſture;</hi> neither without Salt, by reaſon of their mutual union, it followeth from thence, that a biting Mercury, and corroſive and cauſtick Salt is required to the ſubſiſtance of a ſharp Sulphur; as likewiſe a temperate Mercury and ſweet Salt is required for the preſervation of a moderate Sulphur. For theſe three Principles are ever united and joyned very ſtrictly together, whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170969:35"/>from their action, though it appears but little, by reaſon of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Principle, for <hi>à potiori ſumitur denominatio.</hi>

                              <p>Now as the Sulphur of Death, or Mortal Sulphur, doth manifeſt it ſelf in the Arſenical ſubſtances, <hi>Realgar, Auripigment,</hi> &amp;c. the Mercury of Death doth alſo the ſame in all <hi>Narcoticks,</hi> and we have not without reaſon affirmed theſe poyſons to be, not only <hi>terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial,</hi> but <hi>aerial</hi> alſo; for in all the Elements there is much of this malignant Mercury, not yet ſpecified in any individual Body, but flying up and down, and remaining of a volatile nature; and whenſoever it exceeds proportion, doth cauſe an infinite number of Epidemical, Peſtilential, and Contagious Diſeaſes; and if the individual venoms already immerſed in Bodies did not attract it for their nouriſhment, it would infallibly, cauſe a great ſpoyl and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the World.</p>
                              <p>And as Salt is the Principle which cauſes the coaleſcency of ſubſtances in Bodies, or corporification (if we may uſe the word) and that by it Sulphur and Mercury are made viſible and palpable, by reaſon of the coalition of the ſame which it cauſes; ſo the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding Salt, doth alſo corporifie the two other Principles of Death, and renders them viſible by giving them a Body; for theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances otherwiſe ſhould remain inviſible in the Univerſal Spirit, were they not brought to light, and made corporeal by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and help of the Salt, and by this means it is, we finde true, that ſo important Axiom of the great <hi>Triſmegiſt,</hi> when he ſaith, that <hi>Quod eſt occultum fit manifeſtum, et vice verſâ.</hi> The violence and hurtfull nature of this Salt of Death, appears very little in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things; but when Art hath beſtowed its skill, upon one or ſeveral Mixts, then appears its activity, and not before, as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious in all ſublimated Corroſives, <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> Butter of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and ſeveral other Preparations, of this nature, known to the Sons of Art, it is from ſuch a kinde of Salt, that Cancers, Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grenes, Kings-evil, and all other corroding Ulcers are generated in mans body; which is againſt the ſenſe of thoſe, who do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to ſharp and biting humours, the cauſe of theſe Diſeaſes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but Chymical notions of knowledge in natural things, as we ſhall ſhew in the next Book, where we ſhall declare which way the Principles of Death do incorporate themſelves in Man.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE words <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>impure,</hi> may be taken ſeveral wayes; for ſome by <hi>Purity</hi> underſtand what is uſefull and profitable to Mans Nature, and by <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity</hi> what is hurtfull and damageable to it: Others will have that to be <hi>purity</hi> which is <hi>homogeneous,</hi> and all <hi>heterogeneous</hi> ſubſtances to be <hi>impurity;</hi> but it may ſo happen ſometimes, that Heterogeneous ſubſtances ſhall be profitable, and the Homogeneous hurtfull. Thence it may be gathered, that nothing can be ſaid either <hi>pure</hi> or <hi>impure,</hi> abſolutely ſpeaking, but only comparatively, and in reſpect of one thing to another: For as we have already ſaid above, it may happen, that what ſhall offend the one, ſhall help the other; as for Example: Should it not be thought a very great abſurdity to believe, that the bones
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170969:36"/>of Animals ſhould be impure, becauſe men do not eat them, and that their Fleſh only ſhould deſerve the appellation of <hi>pure,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men feed upon it with pleaſure, though the ſame bones be ſo abſolutely neceſſary to the perfection of Animals, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them they ſhould not be what they are, ſince Bones are the ſolideſt part of their ſubſtance.</p>
                        <p>We ſhall not take here <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>impurity</hi> in this ſenſe: but by <hi>purity</hi> we will underſtand, all what in the Mixt or Compound can be found to ſerve our end and purpoſe; as to the contrary, by <hi>impurity</hi> all what oppoſeth it ſelf and contradicts to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in the work: For though in Mixts Bodies there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts hurtfull to mans nature, yet if we ſpeak abſolutely or reſpectively, in reference to the ſame Mixt, the parts of its Compound cannot be ſaid <hi>impure,</hi> ſince they are of the eſtence of it, and do conſtitute his integrality: Moreover theſe parts cannot be damageable to man, but conditionally, ſince nothing compells him, but his own will to make uſe of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Impurity</hi> are in this ſenſe conſidered, either in man, or out of him. The <hi>impurity</hi> found in man doth hinder and diſturb his and Natures intention, which is, that without interruption, he might enjoy a full and entire health: The ſame doth it alſo out of him, ſince we ſuppoſe that it muſt neceſſarily enter and penetrate in him: But this is the difference between theſe two kinde of Impurities; that <hi>inward impurity</hi> doth all immediately by its preſence, and the other is only conſidered as remote and abſent, though it is to be neerer at hand, at ſome time or other. Becauſe, as there is a neceſſity for man to breathe, and receive daily food, ſo can he not avoid the action of that <hi>impurity</hi> wherewith the Air and Elements are ſometimes impregnated, as hereafter we will make it appear, and demonſtrate alſo that in thoſe ſubſtances which by ſome are accounted <hi>pure,</hi> there doth yet remain intermixed abundance of impurity.</p>

                        <p>THere is in every Mixt a Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to its nature, as we have already ſaid above: Now all Mixt perfectly framed, is either Animal, Vegetable or Mineral. Whence we gather, that as the one is the food of the other, as it appears by the mutation of Minerals into Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, and of Vegetables into Animals, and again from Animals into Vegetables and Minerals; ſo is there in every Mixt, a Salt Sulphur and Mercury, Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral, imparted to them by the Univerſal Spirit; for all what receives nutriment receiveth it by its like, and what is diſſimilary, is expelled as an Excrement: and if the expelling faculty is not vigorous and ſtrong enough for this purpoſe, there remains many Excrements in the Compounds, which occaſions many Mineral Diſeaſes in mans body, altogether unknown to vulgar Phyſick, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently out of the reach of her Methodical Remedies and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions.</p>
                        <p>This which I ſay here, cometh to paſs in this manner: When the food is received into mans body, &amp; digeſtion hath ſeparated the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of Mixts, which contribute to its nouriſhment; each part doth attract out of this food, and the Animal Principles therein, that which is moſt proper and Analogous to its nature. But as for thoſe other Principles, which cannot be aſſimilated to our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and are no ſtaffe of our lives, Nature doth expell them by the miniſtery of that faculty which is dedicated to ſuch an Office: But if this faculty be oppreſſed or debilitated, by ſome acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and external cauſe, or by ſome internal diſorder of our <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,</hi> which is the guide and director of our life and health; then do theſe Excrements coagulate themſelves, or turn volatile, according to the Idea which the natural fermentation vitiated by this accidental diſorder, imprints on them; and by this defect
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170969:37"/>are all the Mines of Diſeaſes bred and generated in us. Whence it cometh to paſs, that ſuch Diſeaſes cannot be maſtered nor expelled, but only by ſuch as are firſt very well acquainted with the nature and vice of the Ferment; and ſecondly, with the proper and ſpecifical remedy, which can reſtore our Nature, and appeaſe thoſe irritations of Spirits, which are cauſed for the moſt part by a prepoſterous or corrupt fermentation. For if the ferment be of a <hi>coagulative</hi> nature, it is neceſſary we be acquainted with ſome ſpecifick diſſolvement, which ſhould not prejudice the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle: but if it be ſuch a diſſolvement, as will make an evil col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquation of the nutriment and parts; he that will undertake the Cure with ſucceſs, muſt know what remedy is capable to repair that fault in Nature, and reform its diſorder. Thence proceed the reiterated fits in F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>If our leaſure would give us leave to enlarge here upon ſeveral noble and curious inquiries, we ſhould be taught by this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy the cauſes of ſeveral effects, altogether unknown to moſt men. I will give a touch only by the by, for a proof of it, upon this Queſtion ordinarily moved: <hi>Wherefore Men before the Flood were much ſtronger and long-lived without compariſon, then after that general inundation of the World?</hi> Two reaſons of this effect and wonderfull change we can give, according to the Doctrine layd already before: The firſt, that as the world ſtood then in the beginning, there was yet no change of alteration in the nature of things; which happened ſince, only by the ſeveral mixtures and changes introduced in the Compounds of Nature, after the deſerved Curſe inflicted upon ſin. The ſecond, that the Waters, which are the general Matrixes or Wombs of ſeveral Minerals, and particularly of Salts, had not yet covered all the Earth, neither by conſequence communicated the Mineral ſeeds, to feed the Family of Vegetables, whoſe vertue is thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vitiated, and their firſt nature in a manner altered: Whence the Animals Family hath been made partaker of this defect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it drawes its food and ſuſtenance almoſt from Vegetables; as this chiefly appears in the Vine, which abounds in Tartar,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170969:37"/>which is its proper Salt: Now, that Tartar is a kinde of Mineral, appears by its action, working potently upon Minerals, and with great efficacy upon Metals; for, <hi>all natural action is performed by its like,</hi> and there is a proportion required between the Agent and Patient. But to avoyd here multiplying objections, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand here by this Proportion only a genetical ſimilitude. Theſe things thus premiſed, 'twill not be very difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what is here properly underſtood by <hi>impurity, viz.</hi> That they are Principles of an Heterogeneous and different nature, mixt with other Principles, not of the ſame <hi>Family</hi> nor <hi>Category:</hi> As when Minerals become by ſome way or other, united to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables or Animals: It is alſo very eaſie to obſerve, how <hi>Purity</hi> inſinuates it ſelf in all things, by taking the oppoſite or contre-part of what we have ſaid of <hi>Impurity.</hi> But now will it be neceſſary to ſhew, how <hi>impurity</hi> may be ſevered or baniſhed, ſince it is a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Death and Deſtruction, as <hi>purity</hi> a Principle of Life, as we have ſaid here above.</p>

                        <p>WEE have ſaid <hi>impurity</hi> to be that which could interrupt the perfection of thoſe actions, which do conduct the Mixt to the end of its natural predeſtination: It is then very requiſite to know, how it may be freed from this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick enemy, which inſenſibly doth creep into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds. Now as all Mixts are under ſeveral genders, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and that there is ſeveral ſorts of <hi>impurities,</hi> men have invented ſeveral Arts to correct and take them away: and as the Art of Chymiſtry hath all the things of Nature in general for her object, ſo doth it endeavour to ſhew how they may be freed and extricated from their <hi>impurities:</hi> But becauſe, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularize all the parts of this doctrine, would extend beyond the limits of a Compendious Treatiſe, as this we do intend; we ſhall
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170969:38"/>content our ſelves to ſpeak only of thoſe Impurities, which uſe to happen in Chymical Operations: For, to handle any part of Phyſical Chymiſtry or <hi>Iatrochimy,</hi> is not here our deſign, ſince it could alone fill many Volumes. You are to note only by the by, that there is two ſeveral wayes of removing the <hi>impurity</hi> of things; the firſt <hi>univerſal,</hi> the other <hi>particular:</hi> The firſt is an univerſal medicine, which is or may be extracted from ſeveral ſubjects, after they have been, as much as Art can perform it, reduced to their Univerſality, and deveſted of their ſpecification and natural fermentation, which cauſed them to be this or that determinate Mixt: For this Medicine being by a fit digeſtion, and requiſite coction and maturation, reduced to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of its exaltation; it is ſufficient to expell <hi>impurity</hi> out of all Bodies indifferently, becauſe it inſenſibly conſumes it, both by the help of Fixation and Volatilization. The ſecond is a particular Medicine, which by its ſpecifical vertue and faculty, may expell particular <hi>impurities:</hi> A thing of no ſmall importance, and whoſe ſecret is not to be attained unto but by the true Sons of Art; and thoſe which do joyn together manual Operation and diligent Practice to an indefatigable ſtudy, which do uſe and bring to the <hi>Examen</hi> of Tracts the weight of their reaſon, and never venture their Remedies upon ſick Patients, unleſs groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the infallible Theorems of the nobleſt Philoſophy, and the trueſt Phyſick.</p>
                        <p>To return then to our Operations, we have ſaid above, that by the miniſtery of fire, the Artiſt did ſeparate from each Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, five Subſtances or differing Principles, which though very <hi>pure</hi> in themſelves, yet in ſeveral reſpects may have their <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,</hi> either in reſpect to themſelves, or in reſpect to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: For if we have occaſion to uſe only the Spirit extracted out of a Mixt, and that this Spirit be joyned with ſome portion of the Phlegm of it, we ſhall ſay this Spirit to be <hi>impure</hi> in ſuch a reſpect, and ſo of the other Principles. Now concerning the particular way of ſeparating theſe kinde of <hi>impurities,</hi> we ſhall treat of it in the following Book, but particularly in the firſt Chapter of the laſt Book, to which we referre the Reader.</p>

                        <p>BEſides the five Subſtances or Principles, which we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſaid may be extracted out of natural Compounds, by the miniſtery of fire; there may be yet ſome Eſſences drawn, by diverſifying the Operations of Art, which exalts, and do ennoble the Principles of theſe Mixts, and raiſe it to their <hi>purity.</hi> Theſe Eſſences do not only differ in body, from that of the Compound whence they were extracted, but are advanced alſo to nobler and more efficacious qualities and vertues, than thoſe which during it's intireneſs did adorn their bodies, and after its diſſolution and artificial ſeparation, will poſſeſs more then any of the Principles of the Compound. But though theſe wonderfull Eſſences obtain ſeveral names in the Books of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, who call them <hi>Arcana's, Magiſteries, Elixirs, Tinctures, Panacea's, Specifical Extracts,</hi> &amp;c. they are comprehended ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, under the general notion of <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>purity;</hi> and it proceeds from hence, that after thoſe Eſſences are drawn out of their Mixts, the remainder is commonly rejected as <hi>impure. Paracelſus</hi> in his firſt Book of <hi>Archidoxa's,</hi> ſaith, that the ſix fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Preparations, <hi>viz.

                           </gap>, which ſignifies <hi>fire;</hi> thereby inſinuating, that theſe Eſſences are brought neer and aſſimilated to their firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which is of the nature of Fire, ſince Light it ſelf, which is but Fire, is the firſt Principle of all things: In the ſame place, he calleth alſo the Body <hi>Impurity,</hi> which keepeth in Priſon this myſtery: and therefore ſaith, that he that will enjoy this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, muſt deveſt it of all Corporeity, as it ſhall appear in the ſecond part of this Treatiſe. But it is here to be noted, that when <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſaith, that this myſtery muſt be deveſted of its body, he means only that it muſt be freed of that groſs body wherein it is impriſoned, to impart him a more ſubtle one,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170969:39"/>which he may ſhake off with eaſe, and ſpiritualize himſelf, to be the more capable thereby to penetrate into our laſt digeſtions, and there correct all thoſe defects which <hi>impurity</hi> might have cauſed. This myſtery ſometimes is extracted out of one ſole Mixt, as <hi>Magiſteries</hi> are done; ſometimes of ſeveral Compounds, as <hi>Elixirs,</hi> which will appear more plainly hereunder.</p>
                        <p>But it will not be from our purpoſe, to treat ſuccinctly of Compounds, either perfect or imperfect, and their variety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have already much ſpoken of it in this Treatiſe, and are to ſpeak yet more; conſidering likewiſe that theſe Mixts are the ſubject and matter of Chymical Operations, and further, that it may ſerve as a common and peculiar place of Phyſick, where he that will rightly be informed, to what <hi>Category</hi> each Body doth belong, may have his recourſe: We ſhall then handle in this laſt Chapter of this Book, <hi>the natural generation and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Bodies, and their variety.</hi>

                              <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Of the Alteration, Generation and Corruption of Natural things.</head>
                           <p>IF you will inſiſt upon the Etymology of the word <hi>Alteration,</hi> you ſhall finde it to be nothing elſe but, <hi>A motion by which any ſubject is made different from what it was before:</hi> Or thus, It is a motion by which a ſubject is accidentarily altered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its qualities. In this, Alteration differs from Generation; for Generation is an eſſential and ſubſtantial change, and Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is only an accidental motion of the qualities of a Body: And further, Alteration is only a diſpoſition and preparatory way towards Generation and Corruption: and thence it comes to paſs, that there are two kindes of Alteration; the one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the Body or Subſtance, the other deſtructive of it. In per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective Alteration, all the qualities obſerve a juſt temper of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and an equal harmony, according to the nature of their ſubject, and in order either to preſerve the ſame nature, or aſſume a more perfect one. But in the deſtructive or putrefactive Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, all qualities fall into that diſorder, that they plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their ſubject from its natural conſtitution, as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in fluid bodies, abounding with great ſtore of Phlegm; and is ſeen by Example in Wine, when it begins to corrupt, and grow flat.</p>
                           <p>This is then the difference between Alteration and Generation, that Alteration introduceth no ſubſtantial form into its ſubject; but that which is ſubſtance in the ſubject, receives only ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious quality which it had not before; as for Example, when <hi>heat</hi> or <hi>cold</hi> are generated in any Plant or Animal. But Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a change of ſubſtance, which preſuppoſes not only the production of new qualities in the Subject, but of new ſubſtantial forms alſo: as when out of Bread Blood is engendred, the ſubject or matter of this Bread is not only deprived of the quality of Bread, but alſo of its ſubſtantial and eſſential form, to take the form and quality of Blood: Yet are you to note, that a queſtion upon this may be raiſed, though not wanting its Anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi>
                              <pb n="58" facs="tcp:170969:40"/>That when ſome Phyſical Herb is preſcribed to a Nurſe to feed upon, that the vertue of this Herb may paſs into her Milk, whether it be the ſame numerical quality which was in the Herb, that is now found in the Milk? The Anſwer is negative; though it be the ſame ſpecifical, or rather generical: For as the Milk and the Plant do generically differ, the difference of their quality ſhould alſo be altogether generical. But to ſpeak of theſe things more intelligibly, we ſay with <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> that the vertue of the Plant was incloſed in its Median or Intrinſecal Life, which is neither altered nor corrupted by the Nurſes digeſtions, and ſo is conveyed into her milk, ſetting aſide the ordinary Quiblets and Niceties of Schools, which uſually raiſe more doubts, then they can eſtabliſh truths in Phyſick and Philoſophy. Hence you may learn, how the Generation of one thing is the Corruption of the other: and contrary-wiſe, the Corruption maketh the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Therefore we will ſay no more of Corruption, becauſe whoſoever ſhall underſtand the one, cannot be ignorant in the other: We will only ſuccinctly ſhew, wherein Generation and Corruption, do differ from Creation, Deſtruction or Annihilation. The difference then lyes in this, that Generation and Corruption do preſuppoſe a matter, which muſt be the ſubject of the ſeveral forms introduced into it. But Creation and Deſtruction require no matter; for as the one is the production of ſomething out of nothing, ſo is reciprocally Annihilating performed but upon cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated things. Generation and Corruption are natural motions, proceeding from a ſecond and finite cauſe: but Creation and Deſtruction or Annihilation, can only be the work of an Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent hand, and infinite Cauſe; the diſtance between being and not being, ſomething and nothing, being infinite.</p>
                           <p>Theſe things thus cleared, we come to Mixtion, which is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, <hi>viz.</hi> the one ſo called improperly, which is artificial; the other proper and natural. That improperly called, is but a local approximation of Bodies differing in Nature, confuſedly joyned together, ſo an heap of Corn is improperly called Mixt; this Artificial mixture, in which the parts are really mixt together, but without change or alteration of the whole ſubſtance, is yet double, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is made by <hi>appoſition,</hi> and that which is by <hi>confuſion</hi> of the parts: Appoſition is made, when the things mixt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170969:40"/>together, are divided in parcels ſcarce perceptible to the eye, as when the particles of Wheat and Barley mixt in a heap, are mingled in the ſame maſs of Flower: Confuſion is, when the mixt parcels are not only imperceptibly divided, but alſo ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded together, that they cannot eaſily be ſeparated again, as when Water and Wine are mixed together, and Apothecaryes mix their Druggs, which remain ſo confounded, that none can be longer diſcerned.</p>
                           <p>Natural mixture properly ſo ſaid, is a ſtrict union of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, whence ſome things ſubſtantial doth reſult, and yet diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the other Subſtances which conſtitute it, by the help of Alteration: For by the conjunction of the Principles, a Mixt is generated, whoſe principal form differs from that of its own Principles, as it is made more manifeſt in the diſſolution of the Mixt, according to the <hi>Peripatetical</hi> Axiom, which ſaith that, <hi>Quod eſt ultimum in reſolutione, id fuit primum in compoſitione.</hi> This Alteration, which cauſeth Unition to lead Nature to Union, and thence to Mixtion, hath been already illuſtrated, where we have ſpoken of the conjunction of Salt and Spirit, and the action of Phlegm and Sulphur, which overcome the ſharpneſs and ſower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Salt and Mercury; and when we have ſaid, that the Earth imparts ſolidity and body to theſe ſeveral Subſtances; it is by the means of this Alteration, this union and conjunction, that the natural Compound is framed and produced. And if it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that theſe Principles are rather a work of Art then Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, your recourſe ſhall be for anſwer, to what we have already ſaid in the firſt Section of the firſt Chapter of the firſt Book.</p>

                           <p>HAving ſufficiently diſcourſed at large of thoſe ſingle, pure and homogeneous Subſtances, which we have called Principles; and having illuſtrated their various alterations before their union and mixtion, which maketh up the perfecting of the Compound: it followeth we ſhould ſpeak of ſuch Mixts as are reſulting from this action. All Mixts are perfectly or imperfectly compounded,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170969:41"/>according to the ſtrength or weakneſs of their Principles union. The Body, which is imperfectly compounded, hath only a light coagulation of ſome of the Principles, and not very laſting, neither differenced by ſome principal, ſubſtantial form, which ſhould make it eſſentially to differ from its Principles; as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Ice or Snow, which only differ from Water by adjunction of ſome foraign and adventitious qualities: But the Perfect Mixt is that, which is endowed with a ſubſtantial principal form, diſtinguiſhed from the Principles whereof it is compounded, after their perfect union, and for this reaſon alſo is more laſting; ſuch are all Minerals, Vegetables, and Animals.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe Bodies which are imperfectly compounded, are called <hi>Meteors,</hi> and their difference is great, according to the difference and variety of the Principles which abound in them; for ſome are Sulphureous, others Nitrous, others Aqueous, and ſo of the reſt; of theſe we muſt ſay ſomething, before we ſpeak further of perfectly compounded Mixts: and herein will we imitate the proceſs of Nature in her workmanſhip, which never produceth any perfect Mixt, before her Principles have paſſed through Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teorick Nature, as we ſhall explain hereafter: her method being, never to paſs from one extremity to the other without a mean. Meteors are called (ſometimes) perfectly mixt Bodies, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the nature and form of Mixts is in them, but becauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they preſerve in a manner the nature of Principles, yet they differ in ſome kinde from the natural ſtate of thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; which is the reaſon they are aſſigned a middle condition and nature, between that of pure and unmixt Principles, and Bodies perfectly compounded of them: they are alſo imperfect Mixts, by reaſon of their ſudden generation, and diſſolution: For as the mixture and coagulation of the Principles in thoſe Bodies is imperfect, ſo can they neither be of duration; but are eaſily converted into the nature of the Principle moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in them. The material, remote cauſe of theſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Mixts or Meteors, are the Principles; and the <hi>proxime</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, thoſe fumes and Spirits, into which by the vertue of ſome efficient cauſe, the ſame Principles are turned by volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization and ſpiritualization. But you are to note here, that there is two different kindes of Fumes and Spirits, <hi>viz.</hi> Vapours
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170969:41"/>and Exhalations: Vapour is a hot and moiſt Fume, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently proceeding from Phlegm, if it prove Aqueous; from Oyl or Sulphur, if inflamable; or Mercury, if windy and ſpirituous. Exhalation is a hot and dry Fume, and by conſequence generated from a terreſtrious and earthly Body, and a Principle of Salt: It muſt alſo be noted, that the Vapour is ſaid to be hot and moyſt, becauſe Water converted into Vapour, is elevated by the action of Fire which is inſinuated in it, and for this cauſe (by a <hi>Greek</hi> expreſſion <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>HAving ſhewed, that Nature ever aims at the corporifying and ſpiritualizing Mixts and their Principles, by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Univerſal Spirit, and the vertue and character of particular Matrixes or Wombs, and that wrought by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ferment, and impreſſion of the Idea once received: We muſt alſo now turn our diſcourſe to thoſe Mixts, which are as we have already often ſaid, generated by the Univerſal Spirit only, cloathed under ſome Meteorical Idea; as that appears in the reſolution of Metals and other Minerals, which are converted into Fumes and Exhalations, before they eſcape our ſight, to re-unite themſelves to the Univerſal Spirit; whence we gather, that they muſt have obſerved the ſame degrees of production in their generation, corporification and coagulation.</p>
                           <p>The perfectly compounded Body, is animated or inanimated; the animated Mixt, is that which is adorned with a ſoul, or vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying form, as Plants, Beaſts, and Men; as contrarywiſe, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate Mixt is that which is deprived of all appearance of life, which doth conſiſt in ſenſe and motion.</p>
                           <pb n="62" facs="tcp:170969:42"/>
                           <p>But a Queſtion is here raiſed, <hi>Whether Minerals are animated or no?</hi> To which, without mentioning here the vulgar School-Arguments, to avoid tediouſneſs, we anſwer, That though in theſe Bodies, which are fruits of the Earths Center, we cannot ſo eaſily perceive thoſe manifeſt vital Operations, which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious in Plants and Animals, yet nevertheleſs are they not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deprived thereof; ſince they are multiplyed by a conſtant perpetuity; which moves us to ſay, that as they have a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicative form of their own <hi>ſpecies,</hi> ſo muſt they be endowed with life. Some of the ancient Philoſophers have acknowledged this Life, as when <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>Spumam Nitri fieri, cum ros cecidiſſet, praegnantibus intrariis, ſed n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this ſenſe we ſhall from henceforth term them, as alſo many other ſubſtances, though taken from Animate Bodies: In this manner, we ſay, there are two kindes of Inanimate Bodies, the one extracted from the Earth, the other from the Mixts themſelves, either animate or inanimate: thoſe which are extracted from the bowels of the Earth, are called Minerals, whereof there are three <hi>ſpecies, viz.</hi> Metals, Stones, and middle Minerals, which are alſo called <hi>Marcaſſites.</hi>

                           <p>As for thoſe Mixts which are not digged out of the Earth, human Art hath found a way to draw them ordinarily out of animated bodyes, ſuch are Fruits, Seeds, Roots, Gums, Roſins, Wooll, Cotton, Oyl, Wine, and ſeveral other ſubſtances ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and ſeparated as parts of Animals and Vegetables, no more conſidered as Organical; whoſe Animals are alſo made uſe of (in Chymical Operations) when they are deprived of their life and ſoul. Of all theſe mixt ſubſtances, as much animated as inanimated, ſhall we treat in the following Sections.</p>

                           <p>MIddle Minerals are <hi>Foſſiles</hi> of a middle nature, between Metals and Stones; and partaking in ſomething of the eſſence of both: For by their fuſion they agree with Metals; and with Stones, in their brickle and crumbling nature. Middle Minerals are for the moſt part Metallick Juices, diſſolved or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed, or elſe Metallick and Mineral Earths.</p>
                           <p>The principal <hi>Metallick Juices</hi> are, Firſt, <hi>Salt,</hi> which is a body eaſily crumbled, diſſolving it ſelf in moyſture and coagulating in drought: whence it is evident, that the predominant and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Principle in this Mixt is Salt, whence it borrowes its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, and becauſe it is a Mixt, thence it followes, that it is not deſtituted of other Principles, as it appears by the action of fire upon it, and its Spagitical Anatomy.</p>
                           <p>Salts are either natural or artificial: Nature produceth the firſt kinde, which are called <hi>Foſſile Salts;</hi> Art doth make the other, of which therefore ſeveral <hi>ſpecies</hi> are found; as for Example, <hi>Salgem.</hi> Armoniack, Saltpeter or Nitre, Well or Pit-ſalt, Sea-ſalt, Fountain-ſalt, Aloms, Vitriol or Copporas, which all are endowed with ſpecifical qualities differing the one from the other, according to the nature of their predominant Principles, which are either fixt or volatile, diſſolving or coagulating, as may be ſeen by the diverſity of Operations which may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed upon each kinde of theſe Salts.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Bituminous Subſtances</hi> follow Salts, and comprehend ſeveral various kindes, as <hi>Aſphalium,</hi> Amber yellow or <hi>gris,</hi> Camphire, <hi>Naptha,</hi> Petroly, and Brimſtone, which we difference from the Sulphur as it is a Principle in all things: For this is but a fat and ſtinking Mineral Juice, having in it ſelf a ſubtile, inflamable part, and another terreſtrious and Vitriolick, by which he ſoon deſtroyes Metals, and will ſoon be extinguiſhed if Vitriol doth abound in it. This Brimſtone is either quick (<hi>Sulphur vivum</hi> in the Shops) that is, ſuch as when it is drawn out of the Earth, and never felt the fire; or prepared by Art, and refined by Fire,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170969:43"/>as we have it in Cakes from the Druggiſt. Several various Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies uſefull in Phyſick, are by the help of Art extracted out of theſe Bituminous bodies; as we will more particulary declare in the laſt Book of the Second part of this Chymical Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>

                              <hi>Arſenick</hi> is either Natural or Artificial; the natural is of three kindes, <hi>Auripigment</hi> or <hi>Litharge</hi> of Gold, ſo called for its golden colour; <hi>Sandarak,</hi> which is red; and <hi>Realgar,</hi> which is yellow: the artificial is prepared by a ſublimation of the natural, with Salt.</p>

                              <hi>Antimony</hi> is alſo natural, otherwiſe called Mineral; and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, which is moſt frequent in our uſe, having been melted from the Mineral in Cakes: Of the qualities and choyce of it, its conſtituting parts, and various kindes, we ſhall ſpeak more fully hereafter, where we handle the practice upon this Mineral.</p>

                              <hi>Cinnabar</hi> is a Mineral body, compoſed of Sulphur and Mercury, or Brimſtone and Quick-ſilver, coagulated together to a ſtony hardneſs. The natural is extracted from Mines, where it is found more or leſs mixed with Sand; the artificial is made by ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe two ſubſtances mixt together.</p>

                              <hi>Cadmy</hi> is natural or artificial; the natural is a Metallick Stone, containing in it ſelf the volatile and impute Salt of ſome Metal; there are very many kindes differing one from the other, in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, vertue, and conſiſtency: The artificial is found in Furnaces where Metals uſe to be melted, being nothing elſe but the <hi>Flores</hi> or volatile Salt of Metals, ſublimated and cleaving to the walls of the Furnace; raiſing, as the ſubtileſt part of flower doth in Mills, to the roofs of melting houſes.

                           </p>

To this we might alſo add, all Artificial Earths, as the ſeveral kindes of Lime, made out of feveral ſorts of Stones, and containing in them a corroding Salt, and a ſecret fire.</p>
                           <p>But before we begin with the Section of <hi>Metals,</hi> we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move a difficulty which offers it ſelf in this place; and that is, That ſince Salts are reckoned amongſt Metallick Juices, how
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170969:43"/>can Armoniack Salt, and ſome kinde of the Metallick Earths, of which we have ſpoken above, be placed amongſt <hi>Mareaſſites,</hi> ſince <hi>Marcaſſites</hi> or middle Minerals, do not indeed yield or extend themſelves under the Hammer, but are fuſible; for it is granted that Armoniack doth never melt in the fire, but rather aſcends and ſublimates it ſelf; and ſo likewiſe thoſe Metallick Earths do not melt, but eaſily calcine and ſublimate themſelves in Metallick Flowers. To this we anſwer, that if indeed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack Salt be put alone in a Crucible, it will not melt, but ſublimate; But if this Salt nevertheleſs be mixt with other Salt in fuſion, it will melt together; as likewiſe if Metallick Earths be mixt together alone, they ſhall rather be calcined then melt; but if they be allayed with ſome fuſible body, then are they capable of fuſion: as by Example, When to equal weight of red Copper, is added as much <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> it will melt with the Metal, turn it into a yellow Braſs, and make an augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fifty in the hundred. It is then to be noted, that when <hi>Foſſiles</hi> are divided into Metals, Stones, <hi>Marcaſſites;</hi> by <hi>Marcaſſites</hi> or middle Minerals muſt only be underſtood thoſe bodies which participate, or bear ſome relation with the nature of Stones or Metals, either in reſpect of their fuſibility, or extenſiveneſs, or hardneſs, or ſoftneſs. So that noble Mixt which ſeemeth to be the Maſter-piece of Art, that is Glaſs, muſt in this ſenſe be reckoned amongſt <hi>Marcaſſites,</hi> ſince it eaſily melts, but cannot for all that yield and extend it ſelf under the Hammer, if you except that which was made Malleable at <hi>Rome</hi> (in the time of <hi>Tiberius</hi>) whereof the Secret is periſht with its Author.</p>

                           <p>MEtals are hard bodies, generated in particular Matrixes or Wombs in the bowels of the Earth, which may be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under the Hammer, and melt in the Fire. They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reckoned ſeven in number, which number is referred to the ſeven Planets, whoſe names (in the writings of Chymical Philoſophers) they ſometimes do borrow. They are divided into
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170969:44"/>perfect and imperfect: Perfect, ſay they, are thoſe which nature hath advanced and brought to their ultimate and perfect end. The tokens of which perfection are, perfect fixation, a moſt exact mixtion and union of the conſtitutive parts of thoſe Bodies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with (requiſite) weight, ſound, and colour; capable of bearing a long fuſion, and a ſtrong ignition, without altering their qualities, and loſing of their ſubſtance: There are two of this nature, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sun and Moon, or Gold and Silver. Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Metals are of two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> hard and ſoft; thoſe that are hard, are rather ſuſceptible of ignition then fuſion, as <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> or Iron and Braſs; ſoft, are thoſe which are ſooner ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of fuſion then ignition, as <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> or Tin and Lead. The Mercury or Quick-ſilver is accounted the ſeventh Metal, and is a liquid Metal, for this cauſe called <hi>fluid,</hi> as the other are named <hi>ſolid:</hi> Yet by reaſon of this fluidity, ſome do expell it from the <hi>Claſſis</hi> and number of Metals, and place it amongſt the ſubſtances that are neerly related to Metals, as being a kinde of Meteor of a middle nature between; and even many Philoſophers, will have it the firſt matter of Metals.</p>
                           <p>Metals and Minerals are differenced in ſex, and accordingly ſeveral kinde of Menſtrues are uſed for their diſſolution: ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Regal water can diſſolve Gold, Lead and Antimony, which are accounted of the maſculine ſex; but ordinary <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> is ſufficient to diſſolve the others, which are accounted of the female ſex.</p>
                           <p>Before we put an end to this Section, ſome few Queſtions, which are uſually raiſed, about the nature of Metals, muſt be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated: The firſt Queſtion raiſed, is: <hi>If when ſeveral Metals are melted together, any Metallick</hi> Species, <hi>differing from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, which do make the whole Compound, is thereby raiſed?</hi> To which, the Anſwer is negative, becauſe it is not a true mixture, much leſs a ſtrict and exact Union, but rather a Confuſion, ſince they may be again ſeparated aſunder. There is another Doubt alſo made upon this matter, <hi>Whether or no Metals do ſpecifically differ amongſt themſelves, or only according to the more or leſs perfection:</hi> But <hi>Scaliger</hi> anſwers to this, that Nature hath no more made Metals in order to the production of Gold, then framed other Creatures to the generation of Man; it may be added to this,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170969:44"/>that God created this variety of Metals for the perfection and beautifying of this Univerſe, and the ſeveral uſes wherein men do imploy them: We muſt nevertheleſs acknowledge as a truth, that both Minerals and imperfect Metals participate of the nature of either of the two perfect Metals; and moſt commonly of both together, as it is evident by the extraction which thoſe can make, that are Maſters of the ſecret of this ſeparation, performed either after a preceding digeſtion, or by examining by the true inſtrument of Separation, external Fire, which excites and actuates the internal, potential Fire of things, and is the only Inſtrument of Philoſophers to verifie by deed what I have ſaid: Whence we conclude, that theſe imperfect Metals and Minerals do continually endeavour the perfection of their natural predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, whileſt they are yet in their Mothers Womb; which they are able to do no more, when torn off from their Matrixes. This Queſtion is commonly followed by another, which demands, <hi>Whether the power of Art doth extend to the changing of an imperfect Metal, and may advance it by this Metamorphoſis to the perfection of either of the great Luminaries?</hi> To which out Anſwer is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative; ſince it is certain, that both Art and Nature applying Actives to Paſſives, are capable of great and noble tranſmutations.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170969:45"/>power of Art, to reduce it again to body. For being thus once prepared, it paſſes eaſily to the very laſt digeſtion, where it corrects whatſoever it meets with that is defective; and ſo it alters and changes our body for the better, provided the right Doſis and way of uſing it be known, otherwiſe it would rather prove a devouring Enemy, then a familiar and pleaſing Gueſt.</p>

                           <p>STones are hard Bodies, which neither are extenſible under the hammer, nor meltable in the fire. They are generated in their particular Matrixes out of a Juice, which hath the Idea and Lapidifick ferment imprinted in it ſelf: they receive their various colours, from the various Mines through which their Lapidifick juice, and their Mercurial fumes, or coagulating Spirit doth paſs. They are either opacons, or tranſparent: The tranſparent are either with or without colour; ſo in all likelihood we may ſay, that the Coagulative Spirit of Emerald paſſeth through a Mine of Vitriol or Copper; that of Opal through a Sulphureous Mine; of Ruby and Carbuncle through a golden one; Granats and ſome other like Stones of this nature, draw their colour from Iron, a proof whereof is, that they are attracted by the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; and ſo we may conclude of others. But the Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Spirit of Diamond and Rock Chryſtal, is only a pure and unmixt petrifying Spirit, deprived of all tingent Sulphureity; which by conſequence leaves in it nothing but that lovely and admirable tranſparency, for which they are admired.</p>
                           <p>It is noted, that opacous Stones, are not only generated in the bowels of the Earth or Waters, but alſo in the bowels and entrails of all kinde of Animals, as the ſearchers of Nature have made it manifeſt.</p>
                           <p>Thus briefly we have run over the Nature of Minerals: For in what concerns the Doctrine of their particular hyſtory, we muſt have recourſe to ſuch natural Philoſophers as have exactly and profeſſedly written thereof, as <hi>Georgius Agricola,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus Ercker;</hi> for our intention is, only to make an Abridgement of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170969:45"/>the chief heads, to which you may referre all the natural-Mixts which depend upon, and flow from them.</p>

                           <p>WE have ſaid above, that there were two kindes of Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Mixts, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe that are extracted from the bowels of the Earth, and thoſe that are not; it remains we ſhould ſpeak of theſe laſt, ſince we have, as much as the Lawes of our Abridgement can ſuffer it, diſcourſed of the former. Thoſe which belong to this laſt <hi>Claſſis,</hi> are Juices and Liquors, extracted out of Plants by expreſſion; as alſo mediately or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from Animals: As for Example, Wine, Oyl, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Gums, Roſins, Fruits, Fats, Milk, <hi>Cadavers</hi> and their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts, and many other things, which as remedies are uſed for the reſtauration of mens decayed health.</p>
                           <p>Animate Mixts, are either Vegetables or Animals; Vegetable or Plants are either perfect or imperfect: Perfect Plants are thoſe which have both root and ſtalk or ſurface: Imperfect, which want either of the two,<note n="*">Tuberes ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae, <hi>Puffes.</hi>
                              </note> 
                              <hi>Truſſoli</hi> are of this kinde: for their root makes all their ſubſtance, and contrariwiſe Muſhroms, in which there appears little or no root at all. Perfect Plants are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Hearb, Shrub, and Tree; and each of theſe again ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into an infinite number of differing kindes, the names whereof are to be found in Herbals. The parts of perfect Plants, are principal, or leſs principal; Principal are thoſe which the Vegetative ſoul maketh uſe of in her functions, and they are ſimilary or diſſimilary: Similary again are, liquid or ſolid; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid are Juices and Drops, which if they be aqueous are coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into Gums, if ſulphureous in Roſins; and for this reaſon Gums diſſolve in Liquors of an aqueous nature; and Roſins can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſſolved, but by Oyls, and analogical Liquors. The ſolid parts are the ſubſtance or carneous part, and the fibres of the Plant. The diſſimilar parts, that is to ſay, thoſe which
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170969:46"/>contain in themſelves a diverſity of ſubſtance, are perpetual or annual. Perpetual or laſting long, are the root, the ſtock, the rinde, the marrow and the branches: Annual are thoſe which renew every year, as the buds, flowers, leaves, fruits, ſeeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>As the plants then have a great variety of parts, and they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſeveral kindes; ſo likewiſe Animals, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſimilar and diſſimilar parts, are divided into ſeveral <hi>ſpecies:</hi> for they are either, rational or unrational; the irrational, or beaſts, are perfect or unperfect: Perfect are thoſe which are without caeſure, and for the nouriſhment of their parts do generate blood: Unperfect, ſuch as are Inſects, breed no blood and are divided by ceſures. All beaſts, whether perfect or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, are either greſſile and marching, or reptile and creeping, or natatile, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſwimming, or volatile, <hi>i. e.</hi> flying.

                              <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Firſt Part of this Treatiſe, we have ſhewed unto you the Grounds upon which doth lean all the Theory of <hi>Chymiſtry:</hi> But becauſe we ſaid in the Preface, that <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> was a Senſal Philoſophy, which admits only what the Senſes manifeſt and demonſtrate unto us; it is time for us to come to the Practical part, and Operations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending of it, and to examine, Whether all what we have ſaid above, is grounded upon Senſe. No body muſt admire, that a Science ſhould
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170969:47"/>become Operative; ſince Operation is only to the end of perfecting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, and Contemplation ſeemeth to be only to help Operation; ſo that theſe two ſeem to be inſeparable. And if it be true, that all Doctrine and Knowledge muſt begin by the Senſes, according to the Maxim which ſaith, <hi>Nihil eſſe in Intellectu, quod non prius fuerit in Senſu;</hi> I think it very neceſſary that the Senſes be well informed and inſtructed by ſeveral Experiences, before you give your ſelf to the Theory, or begin to contemplate upon Natural things, leſt you fall into the error of thoſe ſuperficial Philoſophers, who pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in arguing upon the Principles of ſome Doctrine, whereof expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience diſcovers the untruth; as for Example: Is it not a very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and palpable error, to imagine that the Smoak or Fume, which any Mixt doth yield by violent diſſolution, ſhould be a Fire or Elementary Air, or ſome unmixt Subſtance; ſince, if they are examined in a Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck, or any other Veſſel or Receiver, experience will demonſtrate to the ſenſe, that that Flame or Smoak, are neither pure Elements nor imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Mixts; but that it is ſometimes the Body of a moſt perfect Mixt, as evidently appears by ſubliming of Brimſtone and Armoniack Salt, and the Fumes of Mercury, which is the ſame Quick-ſilver, who like unto that <hi>Proteus</hi> of the ancient Poets, takes all ſorts of ſhapes and colours; but returns again to its firſt nature, being revived.</p>
                           <p>By this it appears, that it is not good to judge of things lightly; as to ſay that all Smoak is Air, becauſe it hath ſome reſemblance with Air: For though all Vapours and Exhalations are alike unto the ſight, yet nevertheleſs are they of a very different nature; as thoſe that examine them thoroughly, and ſearch them narrowly, by the help of Chymical Veſſels will diſcover; and this ſhall we demonſtrate by the ſeveral Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, whereof we are to treat in this laſt Part.</p>
                           <p>But becauſe in the practical part of theſe Operations, we meet with ſeveral terms that are proper and eſſential to the Art of Chymiſtry, and ſeem to be of difficult underſtanding, it is neceſſary, before we enter into the diſcourſe of Operations, to explain their meaning. We ſhall then in this Firſt Book, treat of the ſeveral kindes of Solutions and Coagulations; becauſe one of the chief ends of Chymiſtry is to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualize and corporifie again, thereby to ſeparate Purity from Impurity: after this, we will ſhew the ſeveral degrees of Fire; by the means of which, and the help of ſeveral Furnaces, and divers Veſſels, that true exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is attained unto, which from the myſtery of each Mixt's nature,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170969:48"/>doth extract the <hi>Arcanum, Elixit, Tincture,</hi> or ſome ſublime Eſſence graduated to ſuch a height, as one drop or grain of theſe miraculous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medyes may without compariſon be more efficacious then many pounds of the groſſe and bodily Mixt, out of which theſe Medicaments have been extracted.</p>

                           <p>THough Chymiſtry takes for its object all natural Bodies, yet properly and particularly ſhe confines her Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon Mixt Bodies, which ſhe reacheth how to exalt by the help of Solution and Coagulation, who do contain under them ſeveral kinds of Operations, tending all either to ſpiritualize or corporifie, Minerals, Vegetables, and Animals: ſo that the exaltation of any Mixt or Compound, is nothing elſe but the pureſt part of the ſame, by the help of ſeveral So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and Coagulations often reiterated, brought to its higheſt perfection. To attain this point, Purity firſt muſt be ſeparated from Impurity, which is performed materially or formally: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially, by cribration or ſifting, ablution or waſhing, edulco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or ſweetening, deterſion or cleanſing, effuſion or powring, colation and philtration, or running through a bag, and deſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: Formally, by diſtillation, ſublimation, digeſtion, and ſeveral other reiterated Operations, whereof hereafter.</p>
                           <p>The ſeparation of Purity and Impurity being performed, to obtain a perfect exaltation of the Mixt, the impurity of it muſt be rejected, and that which is pure be firſt put in Solution, then Coagulation; which is done either by reducing it to very ſmall Particles, or to Liquor, or elſe in a ſolid Body, by help of the following Operations, <hi>viz.</hi> Limation or filing, raſion or ſcraping, pulveriſation or reducing to powder, alkoholiſation or reducing to atomical parts, inciſion or cutting, granulation or reducing into ſmall grains by melting, lamination or converting
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170969:48"/>into thin Plates, putrefaction, fermentation, maceration, fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, which is either dry or moyſt, cohobation, precipitation, amalgamation, diſtillation, rectification, ſublimation, calcination either actual or potential, vitrification, projection, lapidification, extinction, fuſion, liquation, cementation, ſtratification, reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, fulmination or detonation, extraction, expreſſion, ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, digeſtion, evaporation, deſiccation, exhalation, circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, congelation, cryſtallization, fixation, volatiliſation, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualization, corporification, mortification and revivification; all which terms, to remove obſcurities in the underſtanding of the Artiſt, we will further illuſtrate in this Chapter.</p>

                              <hi>Ablution</hi> or lotion is, when the matter to be cleanſed from its groſſer impurities, is waſhed in water; but when the matter by its weight is fallen in the bottom of the Veſſel, and the water powred out by inclination, it is called <hi>Effuſion.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Edulcoration</hi> is, when the ſpirituous, ſaline, and corroſive parts of Chymical Preparations, performed by actual or potential cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination, are ſeparated.</p>
                           <p>That matter which cannot endure water without alteration, or loſs of its ſubſtance, is purged by <hi>Deterſion;</hi> and if it be put in any convenient Liquor, and then afterwards groſſely expreſſed, either through a Linnen, or ſome other Strainer of Cloth or Tamy, it is called <hi>Colation</hi> or Percolation: but if this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be performed through ſome more compact ſubſtance, it will be called <hi>Philtration,</hi> which is performed either by the Cloth, Paper, or Ragge; that which is performed through the Paper, is cleanlier and exacter.</p>

                           <p>By <hi>Granulation,</hi> Mineral and Metallick Bodies are reduced to ſmall grains, and by Lamination extended in ſmall and thin Plates, as are Gold, Silver, Leaf Copper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                              <hi>Putrefaction</hi> is, when the Mixt by a moyſt heat without any mixture tends to its corruption: and if it be performed by the mixture or addition of any Ferment, as Tartar, common Salt, Yeaſt of Beer, Leaven of Bread, or Lees of Wine, it is then called Fermentation.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Maceration</hi> is, when any matter is put in a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> or proper liquor to infuſe, that liquor being choſen according to the deſign or intention of the Artiſt, to extract the vertue of the Body upon which it works. This Operation requires a fit and competent time for compleating the Extraction, which retards or advances, according to the more or leſs ſolidity and compacted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the body wrought upon.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fumigation</hi> is a Corroſion of the external parts of a body by a vapour, or ſharp and corroding Exhalation: If it be by a vapour, as is that of Vinegar, it is a moiſt fumigation: if by Exhalation, as the fumes of Lead or Quick-ſilver, it is a dry fumigation, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cining laminated Metals, or reduced in Plates, and making them ſo crumbling and brickle, that they may afterwards be eaſily reduced to powder.</p>

                              <hi>Cohobation</hi> is done, by often powring again the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> extracted out of one or ſeveral Mixts upon its own feces, or the remainder of thoſe Mixts in the Receiver, either to draw the Central Vertues encloſed in thoſe Compounds, or to cauſe the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170969:49"/>ſame feces, to reſume and take back, what in the diſtillation they had ſuffered to flie up and volatilize by the action of heat, and in this only Operation doth Cohobation conſiſt.</p>

                              <hi>Precipitation</hi> cauſeth the diſſolving <hi>Menſtruum</hi> to quit the body which it had diſſolved, which is performed by the analogy that Salts have with Spirits; for, <hi>Whatſoever is diſſolved by Spirits, is precipitated by Salts; and contrarywiſe.</hi> This Operation requires the particular conſideration of the Artiſt, becauſe it gives great light, and is a great key to comprehend the generation and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of natural things.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Amalgamation</hi> is a particular calcination of Metals, which ſome Authors do call <hi>Philoſophical Calcination:</hi> It is performed by the union of Mercury or Quick-ſilver with the leaſt particles of Metals, which doth ſo ſeparate and open them, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unctuous and extenſible upon the hand; ſo that evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Quick-ſilver with a convenient heat, the Metals are reduced to a very ſubtile <hi>Calx,</hi> which cannot be performed ſo well by any other means.</p>

                              <hi>Diſtillation</hi> is, when the matter incloſed in a Veſſel, drives and ſends up vapours in another Veſſel, by the help and activity of Fire: There are three <hi>ſpecies</hi> of it. The firſt, when the vapour of diſtilled Subſtances do aſcend. The ſecond, when the ſame vapours are driven by the ſide of the Veſſel: And the third, when downwards: all theſe according to the diſtillable matters, and the fitneſs of the Veſſels for Operation.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Rectification</hi> is nothing elſe but a reiterated Diſtillation, and that to ſubtilize the more the diſtilled vapours, or ſeparate ſome Spirit from its Phlegm, and the more-terreſtrial and groſs parts, according as the Spirits are, either ſharp and fixed, or volatile and inflamable.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sublimation</hi> is an Operation, by which the action and heat of Fire, elevates a whole body, in dry Exhalations, or at leaſt ſome part of it which cleaves and condenſes it ſelf in thin and ſubtile <hi>Flores,</hi> or ſometimes thick, compacted and preſſed in the top of the Veſſel: this manner of Operation is oppoſed to <hi>Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>

                              <hi>Calcination</hi> is a violent action, which reduces the Mixt to <hi>Calx</hi> and Aſhes. It is double, actual and potential: the actual is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170969:50"/>performed by flaming Wood or kindled Coals, which are the material fire: Potential Calcination is that which is made by the ſecret and potential fire of ſtrong and diſſolutive Waters, or <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> ſingle or compounded, and by the vapours and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive fumes, as it is obſerved in Precipitation and Fumiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Vitrification</hi> is the change of Metals, Minerals, Vegetables or Stones in Glaſs, and that by projection after their fuſion, or by addition of Salts, <hi>Alkali</hi> or fixt, or extracted from Lees, which do penetrate and purifie theſe ſeveral ſubſtances, and vitrifie them by giving them fuſibility and tranſparency: There are many nevertheleſs Opacous alſo, which are uſed for enamelling, and called <hi>Amels.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Lapidification</hi> is when Metals are changed into Stones or Paſts, which in a kinde are of a middle nature, between Metallick and Tranſparent Glaſſes; and Amels, becauſe they are ſuſceptible of a fair poliſhing.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Extinction</hi> is the ſuffocation and cooling of a hot kindled ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſome Liquor, either to the end of extracting its vertue and communicating it to the Liquor, or to impart ſome adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious quality to the ſubſtance immerſed; as when, for Example, <hi>Tuty</hi> or <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> is extinguiſhed in Fennel water or Vinegar, to make them more efficacious for the cure of the Eyes; as alſo all Iron and Steel Tools are dipt, to become thereby more apt for poliſhing, and receive a hardneſs, and conſequently an edge.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fuſion</hi> is properly ſaid of Metals and Minerals, and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a great and violent Ignition. And <hi>Liquation</hi> is only ſaid of the fat of Animals, Wax, and unctuous fat and reſinous ſubſtances of Vegetables, performed by a temperate heat.</p>
                           <p>The Impurities of Metals are removed by <hi>Cementation;</hi> it ſerves alſo to examine them, whether they are true or falſe, as alſo to leſſen their bulk by the compreſſing of their parts, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſtratification, making a bed or lay of Cement, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Metallick Plates, and ſo continuing <hi>ſtratum ſuper ſtratum,</hi> or lay upon lay, till the Veſſel be top full; but you are to note, that the firſt and the laſt lay muſt be of Cement, after which the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170969:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>Pot or Crucible muſt be exactly luted, to give a Circular fire by degrees untill fuſion.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Reverberation</hi> is an Ignition, by which Bodies are calcined with a flaming fire in a Reverberatory Furnace: Whether it be done to the end corroſive Spirits may be ſeparated from it, or to ſubtilize and ſoften the body with that Operation.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fulmination</hi> or <hi>Fulguration</hi> is an Operation, by which all Metals, excepting Gold and Silver, are meteorized, and driven or reduced into vapours, exhalations, and fumes; by the help of Lead in a Copell, with violence of fire kindled and animated with good and ample Bellowes.</p>
                           <p>The end of <hi>Detonation</hi> is to drive away and ſeparate all the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous and Mercurial parts of a Body which are not pure, that there may remain the earthly part only, which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed by the internal and fixt Sulphur, in which is properly inherent the vertue of Minerals. This Operation is performed by the help of Salt-peter or Nitre, as it appears in the Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Diaphoretical Antimony, made by Detonation and Fuſion.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Extraction</hi> is, when the eſſence or tincture of a Mixt is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, by help of a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> or convenient Liquor, which the Artiſt doth evaporate away, if it be unuſefull and of ſmall value; but if of any price, he draweth it again by Diſtillation, to uſe it in other Operations; that which remains in the bottom of the Veſſel is called Extract.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Expreſſion</hi> tends to ſeparate the ſubtileſt from the groſſer parts of the body, according to the intention of the Artiſt, to preſerve the one or the other, it is performed by a Preſſe which ſcrewes, or otherwiſe, and Tables.</p>

                              <hi>Digeſtion</hi> is one of the principal and moſt neceſſary Operations of Chymiſtry; becauſe Mixts are made tractable by it, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to yield us what we deſire out of them; it is performed by the means of a convenient <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and a ſlow and long heat: moſt commonly joynted Veſſels meeting at the mouth, called properly Circulatory, are employed for this purpoſe, that nothing of the volatile ſpirits of the digeſted Subſtance may be loſt; to this Operation are commonly made uſe of, the heat of a watery Bath <hi>(Balneum maris)</hi> or vaporous, or aerial, or the

                           <p>The <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> which hath been uſed in Diſſolution or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, is by evaporation reduced to vapour, and this way is <hi>Deſiccation</hi> performed: but by Exhalation the drye ſpirits are carryed away from the ſubſtance by the vertue of the fire, and reduced to Exhalations.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Circulation</hi> is an Operation, by which the ſubſtances, contained in the bottom of a Pelican, or Circulatory Veſſel, are driven upwards by the action of heat, and thence fall again upon them-themſelves, either to volatilize them by the help of ſpirits, or to fix the ſpirit by the frequent and reiterated contract of the body; which is a thing very well worthy the contemplation of him that will attain the true knowledge of Nature.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Congelation</hi> is, when the ſolid parts of Animals are, with ſome convenient <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> reduced to a Jelly by Elixation: Such are the Jellies of Horns, Bones, Muſcles, Sinews, and Cartilages; but you are to note, that this Congelation proceeds only from the volatile Salt, which abounds in Animals: As <hi>Cryſtallization</hi> is properly ſaid of Salts purified by ſeveral Solutions, Filtrations, and Cryſtallizations, after the Liquor in which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, hath been evaporated to a skin.</p>
                           <p>Things volatile are fixed by <hi>Fixation,</hi> as contrarywiſe Fixt are volatilized by <hi>Volatilization.</hi> That ſubſtance is called fixt, which abides and is permanent in the fire; as volatile is called that which flyes and exhaleth it ſelf with the leaſt heat. But note here, that as there are ſeveral degrees of heat, ſo there is ſeveral things fixt, and ſeveral volatile.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Spiritualization</hi> doth change the whole body into Spirit, ſo that it becomes no more palpable nor ſenſible to us: And by <hi>Corporification,</hi> the Spirit re-aſſumes its Body, and manifeſts it ſelf again to our ſenſes; but the body ſo qualified is an exalted body, very different in vertue from that from which it hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, ſince this body ſo glorified contains in it ſelf the myſtery of its own Mixt.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the ſeveral degrees of Heat and Fire.</head>
                           <p>THE moſt potent Agent that Nature hath furniſhed us withall under Heaven, to perform the Anatomy of Mixt Bodies, is <hi>Fire;</hi> which to feed and maintain it ſelf, doth need firſt a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible oily and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>phureous matter, either Mineral as Sea-coal, or Vegetable as Chark-coal, and the Oyls of Vegetables; or finally, Animals Fats, Suets and Oyls of Animals. Secondly, Fire needs a continual Air, that may by its action drive away the excrements and fuliginous emanations of the ſubſtances which are burned, and that may animate the Fire, to make it more or leſs act upon its ſubject; and from this neceſſity it is that ſome, though improperly, have affirmed, that the Air was the true food and nouriſhment of Fire. If we will exactly ſpeak, it cannot be ſaid, that Fire receives more or leſs by it ſelf or in it ſelf, or as Philoſophers ſpeak, admits of intention or remiſſion; Though the matter upon which it doth act, may receive great variety of degrees of heat, according to its neerneſs or diſtance, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of things which may receive the impreſſion of heat; whence it neceſſarily followes, that the ordering of the heat of Fire, doth conſiſt in a juſt and convenient quantity, adminiſtred by the Artiſt, according to the nature and condition of the matter upon which he worketh, and according to the means or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he uſes, to whom it is required he ſhould give a proportionate diſtance.</p>
                           <pb n="82" facs="tcp:170969:52"/>
                           <p>To encreaſe the Fire, it is required, either to add a greater quantity of Coals in the Fire, or if there be enough, and that the Artiſt doth finde it not to burn according to his expectation, there muſt be more Air let in, either by the dore or mouth of the Furnace which receives the Fire, or by the Aſh-hole, which is better: as alſo by opening the Regiſters, which are uſually made either at the upper part, or in the ſides of the Furnaces, to let out exhalations and fuliginous vapours, which commonly ſuffocate the Fire; or laſtly, by blowing large bellowes, and of a capacious body for room of winde. From this that is ſaid may be conceived, that Fire may be decreaſed and weakened by the contrary wayes, as ſhutting the Dores and Regiſters, to hinder the entring of Air, and iſſue of fuliginous ſubſtances; or the combuſtible matter muſt be diminiſhed, or the Fire covered with cold Aſhes, or a plate of Iron, or a Brick, to hinder ſuch diſorders and accidents as uſually happen in the midſt of the work.</p>
                           <p>As for the diſtance of the Veſſels containing the matter, it can only be judged according to the nature of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                              </gap>e upon bodies, is mediate or immediate; Immediate, when without oppoſition Fire acts upon the matter, or Veſſel that contains it, whether it be a Crucible, Retort, or any other thing; and this is commonly called <hi>Open Fire;</hi> Fire of Calcination and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: Mediate is, when any thing is interpoſed between the Fire and the matter, which doth hinder its deſtructive action; whereby the Artiſt is enabled to govern it, not otherwiſe then a skilfull rider manages a Horſes, and keeps him in awe, by the help of the Bridle which he holds in his hand.</p>
                           <p>We ſhall compriſe under nine chief Claſſes, the ſeveral diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring degrees of Heat, and theſe the ingenuous Artiſt may yet vary in an infinite number of manners, according to his intention, and that the quality of the Mixt upon which he works, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it: Thoſe differences are as followeth.</p>
                           <pb n="83" facs="tcp:170969:52"/>
                           <p>We will take the firſt degree of Heat from the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of its height, which is the fire of Flame, which calcines and reverberates all things; and this is that properly, which is capable to turn the moſt ſolid and fixt Bodies into Vapours and Exhalations.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond is that of Coals, which properly and principally ſerves for Cementation, for colouring and purging, as well as for contracting Metals, as alſo thoſe Minerals which participate moſt of Metallick nature. It is ſometimes called <hi>Circulatory</hi> Fire, <hi>(Ignis rotae;)</hi> ſometimes Fire of ſuppreſſion, according as the fire is placed above, under, or at the ſides.</p>
                           <p>The third degree of Intenſe Fire, is that of the Iron Plate, when it is red hot at the higheſt; which is a kinde of heat proper to trye Metallick Tinctures, as well as the degree of Fixation of Mineral remedies.</p>
                           <p>The fourth is that which is maintained by the filings of Iron put in a <hi>Capſula</hi> or Kettle of the ſame Mettal; and this, becauſe this ſubſtance being once heated, preſerves its heat much longer then the other, and communicates it to the Veſſel put into it, which contains the matter that is either to be diſtilled, digeſted or concocted, with a greater activity.</p>
                           <p>The fifth is the Fire of Furnace, with Sand interpoſed to the Veſſel; it preſerves, and yields a leſs heat then that of the filings of Iron, becauſe it takes heat more ſlowly, and ſooner cooleth, and is more eaſily kept in order, by the help of the Regiſters of the Furnace.</p>
                           <p>The ſixth is the heat of Aſhes, which in reſpect of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going degrees, begins to be temperate: This Fire commonly is uſed in the Extractions of ſuch Mixts as are of a middle ſubſtance, either Animals or Vegetables, as alſo in their digeſtions and evaporations.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi> or (to ſpeak more properly) <hi>Balneum Maris,</hi> maketh the ſeventh of our Claſſes or degrees; and it is the moſt conſiderable of all, as that which conſtitutes the moſt excellent and uſefull part of the work of Chymiſtry; becauſe an underſtanding Artiſt may manage it with that judgement and proportion, that he may with its help perform a number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs variety of Operations, which by any other imaginable way,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170969:53"/>are not to be attained unto: For this Bath may be boyling hot, half boyling, ſimpring, luke-warm, half luke-warm, and be yet ſo ordered as to keep the middle proportions of all theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees too.</p>
                           <p>The eighth degree of well graduated Fite, is the Vaporous Bath, for the Veſſels may be only put to the vapour of the water contained in the Bath: And for the ninth, there may be put about the Veſſel ſawings of Wood to receive the vapour, as alſo Oaten Chaffe, or any other, ſhred very ſmall, becauſe they are bodies which eaſily attract this vapour and heat, and keep it long in ſlow, and almoſt perfectly equal temper.</p>
                           <p>Beſides all theſe degrees and kindes of Heat ſpoken of, there remains yet the Lamp-fire, which may be graduated according to the diſtance or neerneſs of the Lamp, which ſhall have one or more Weeks; theſe weeks ſhall have two, three, four, or more threds, according as you intend to give a leſs or greater temper of heat to your matter; this Heat is chiefly uſed for Coction and Fixation.</p>
                           <p>The invention of ingenuous Chymiſts hath found out, beſides this, ſeveral kindes of cheap Heats, as that of the Sun, either expoſing your matter to the reflexion of the rayes of his light, received by ſome Body, more or leſs capable to reflect them; or concerning the rayes of the ſame Light, by the help of a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Glaſs, an Inſtrument whoſe invention may ſtrike with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the beſt Philoſophers, that are not well acquainted with the ſphere of its activity, ſince the moſt obvious effects of it are, to melt Metals, according to the ſection and bigneſs of the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of theſe admirable Inſtruments. But that which of all is more worth enquiry, and ſurprizes more, is, that this Fire is a Magical Fire, differing from all other; ſince the vulgar is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, and this to the contrary preſerves and multiplyes, as experience doth verifie in the <hi>Solar Calcination</hi> of Antimony, which loſes its impure Mercury and Sulphur, vapouring away in this Operation, whereby it would be thought the body ſhould diminiſh; whereas it acquires a cordial and diaphoretick vertue, with a conſiderable addition of weight: which is thus proved. If you calcine in vulgar fire ten grains of this Mineral, it dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth to four, and conſequently there remains but ſix, which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170969:53"/>have yet a Cathartick and Emetick faculty: but if you calcine the ſame quantity with the Solar Fire, beſides that it loſes its ill qualities, by the Exhalation made of its Impurities, which no queſtion have ſome weight, and ſeem in the Operation to have diminiſht the ten grains; you ſhall, inſtead of that, the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration being ended, finde twelve grains of matter endowed with an admirable vertue; and this with juſt reaſon ſtrikes into amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſubtileſt and moſt ſearching Wits; for, compare this to the other Operation, and you cannot but confeſs, that the augmentation is of a juſt full half. But it will allay ſomething your aſtoniſhment, if you are acquainted a little more with the nature of this miraculous Fire, and can comprehend, that Light is that <hi>Promethean</hi> Fire, which gives life to all natural bodies, is their Principle, and indiviſibly joyns it ſelf to its like, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it meers with it in any ſubject.</p>
                           <p>Chymical Artiſts do likewiſe make uſe of Horſe-dung, which yields a puttefying heat, ſpecially recommended by <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> in the opening of the moſt ſolid and fixt Bodies, as are thoſe of Metals and Minerals: To extract the eaſſier thoſe noble remedies which he doth teach us, we may ſubſtitute to the Horſe-dung, that of hot Bathes and Mineral Springs heared by Nature it ſelf, as alſo that of <hi>Balneum Maris,</hi> which is Artificial, provided the requiſite proportions be underſtood.</p>

                           <p>THE matters which the Artiſt works upon, are not often put on the open bear fire: But that it is neceſſarily required they ſhould be encloſed in fit and convenient Veſſels, according to the intention of the work; which Veſſels are to be ſet artificially and with great judgement upon the fire, whoſe action is mediate or immediate; to the end that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſubſtances vaniſh not, and be loſt without proof, but
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170969:54"/>rather carefully and curiouſly preſerved: We ſhall treat in this Chapter of the variety of thoſe Veſſels, and the ſeveral uſes unto which they are ſerviceable.</p>
                           <p>Now theſe Veſſels are to be conſidered either according to their matter, or their form; becauſe they are the two eſſential parts, which make them to be uſed in the Operations of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry, and their differences is as great, as the fancies and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions are various in the mindes of Artiſts. And as they are ſince many Ages in queſt of the perfection of the Operations of this Art, ſo ſhall we only trace, in more general tearms, the greateſt part of the more neceſſary Inſtruments, to leave a lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of liberty to the invention of thoſe which will addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this Noble Art, after they are once introduced to attain to the moſt ſecret and abſtruſe knowledges of it, by the rare Preparations which are made by the means and aſſiſtance of the ſame.</p>
                           <p>There muſt ever be a care had to chooſe the cleanlieſt matter for the fabrick of Veſſels, which muſt alſo be preſſed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted, that the ſubtileſt portions of matter may not tranſpire, and that the ſubſtance of the Veſſels may not communicate any forain quality to the matter, whether ſingle or compounded, upon which the Chymiſt doth operate. Glaſs is the body, which exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all others, would be the fitteſt to be employed, both by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its compactedneſs, and cleanly nature, were it capable to endure all the actions of Fire; but its fuſibility, and the ſeveral accidents which may cauſe it to break, notwithſtanding all the care and foreſight of Artiſts, make it neceſſary to have a recourſe to ſome other matters which may be capable of reſiſting Fire, and may not break ſo eaſily: As, for one, to Potters Clay, which furniſhes ſeveral Veſſels to the ſervice and uſe of Chymiſtry, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeveral kindes of Clay, and their poroſity; for if it be ſaid, that it may be glaſed within with ſome Mineral or Metallick ſubſtances (as Leaden oar. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which will hinder tranſpiration, it is as ſoon anſwered, that this Preparation makes them not differing from the nature of Glaſs, and ſo conſequently ſubject to the ſame inconveniencies, as Glaſs is: For, beſides their ordinary brickleneſs, there muſt alſo a great regard be had, not to expoſe them too ſoon from heat to cold, nor from cold to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170969:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>heat, becauſe compreſſion or rarefaction of the parts, and the air in them, would ſoon cauſe them to fly in pieces.</p>
                           <p>There is alſo ſome uſe of Metallick Veſſels for many Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this Art, which without their help would prove very difficult, yea almoſt impoſſible; as much by reaſon of the activity of Fire, deſtroying and conſuming whatſoever comes neer it, as for the ſeveral m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>tters upon which the Artiſt doth uſe to work: for, to contain ſharp, acid, ſaline, nitrous, vitriolick and alumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſubſtances, Glaſs, or leaded or glaſed Pots, are neceſſary; as contrariwiſe when you intend to diſtill ſpirit of Wine in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, Metallick Veſſels that may long abide an open Fire, and contain much matter, are requiſite. Diſtilled Oyls of Vegetables cannot alſo be drawn without theſe Veſſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>, becauſe theſe Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations require a violent and long fire to diſunite the Balſamick and Aethereal parts from the other, which are terreſtial and ſaline, which cannot be ſeparated without much ebullition, and ſtore of water. But you are to note, that when you intend to work upon Mercury (which you are to underſtand henceforth to be Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver) you muſt never make uſe of any Metallick Veſſel, becauſe this Metallick Body will eaſily amalgam and mix it ſelf with the greateſt part of Metals, though with greater eaſe with ſome then others. Thus much in ſhort concerning the matter of Chymical Veſſels.</p>
                           <p>As for the diverſity of their form, it is diſtinguiſhed according to the requiſite or intended Operations. For when the diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is intended, we uſe <hi>Cucurbites</hi> with their head — or Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck, as alſo the braſs Body, or <hi>Veſica,</hi> covered with the Moors head, made of the ſame Metal or Tin, leſt the Spirits or diſtilled Oyls ſhould draw any vitriolick ſubſtance from the Copper; And to prevent the ſame inconveniency, it will be very requiſite, that all the Copper Veſſels which are to be uſed by the Artiſt, be tinned within: For the diſtillation of new Fruits, juicy Plants, or Flowers, are to be uſed great and large Baſons, on the top whereof a Tin Bell or diſtilling head is to be applyed: And theſe three kindes of Veſſels, are ſufficient for the diſtillation of all vapours extracted by aſcenſion. But for performing the diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch vapours as are droven by the ſides, Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>orts and great Receivers are neceſſary, as Artiſts have found by experience,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170969:55"/>becauſe ſuch vapours cannot aſcend by reaſon of their heavineſs; it is alſo ſometimes requiſite to have earthen Retorts, or of Metal opened above, as alſo Receivers with three necks or channels, to change and fit others to the firſt, with more eaſe and diſpatch when occaſion requires, and to condenſe more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpeedily the Exhalations and vapours which the matter urged by the Fire's action doth yield; for were it not for that, either of neceſſity the Veſſel containing the matter muſt break, or the Recipient fly into pieces, if not changed, becauſe it would not be capacious enough to contain the vapour or ſpirits droven in by the Fire.</p>
                           <p>For digeſtion long neck'd Matraſſes and narrow mouth'd, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: double Veſſels may alſo be uſed to this purpoſe, which are two Veſſels whoſe mouths are placed one in the other, that nothing of what is fitting to be kept in, may evaporate.</p>
                           <p>Pelicans are uſed for Circulation, as alſo twins, which are two Cucurbites with their heads, whoſe noſes are reciprocally inſerted in the body of the oppoſite Cucurbite. The double Veſſels may alſo be made uſe of for this Operation, but they are not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious. For ſublimation Aludels are employed, or ſome analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous Veſſels, as ſeveral earthen Pots put one in another; as alſo diſtillatory heads, or blinde Limbecks without noſe: ſtrong and well glued blew Paper ſhaped in a <hi>Conick Figure</hi> is alſo uſed, to receive the Exhalations of the ſublimed matters, as we ſhall teach more particularly in the ſublimation of <hi>Benjimin</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                           <p>For Fuſion or melting, as alſo Cementation and Calcination, it is requiſite to be provided with Crucibles made with a good Earth, and well abiding the Fire, and capable to keep the Salts in fuſion, and hinder the vaporation of their ſpirits, as alſo to keep Metals in fuſion: There muſt alſo be coverings for the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibles, that may eaſily be put on or removed with the Pincers, that no Coals or any other Mixture, may fall into the matter whileſt it is upon the fire, or that they may exactly be luted to the Crucibles, as it is practiſed in Cementations.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Diverſity of all ſorts of Furnaces.</head>
                           <p>IT doth not ſuffice, that the Artiſt be provided with Fire and Veſſels, he muſt have alſo his Furnaces to regulate and govern his heat, and put his Veſſels in that degree of Fire, which he ſhall judge moſt fitting and convenient for the matter in them contained. Furnaces are Inſtruments deſtinated to thoſe Operations, that are performed by the help of Fire, that heat may be as it were kept in awe and bridled, to ſubmit it ſelf to the judgement, skill, and intention of the Artiſt. They have ſeveral names given them, according to the ſeveral Operations to which they are appropriated: For, they are either fixt and immovable, or moveable and to be tranſported. We will only
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170969:58"/>ſpeak here of the Unmoveable, ſince they are the moſt uſefull kinde for Chymical Operations; leaving the other to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and fancy of thoſe whom their curioſity leads to this noble Art. The matter of Furnaces is threefold; Bricks, Clay, and Iron-work; their form is according to their uſe.</p>
                           <p>Every Furnace muſt conſiſt of four neceſſary parts, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever form they be, which are; Firſt, the Hearth or Aſh-room, with its hole or mouth, to take away the Aſhes falling from the Coals. Secondly, the Grate which receives and keeps up the Coals. Thirdly, the Chafing-diſh or <hi>Focus</hi> with its dore to throw the Coals upon the Grate; wherein are the Regiſters, whereby the degrees of heat of the kindled Coals are ruled and moderated. Finally, the Shop or Laboratory, which muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Veſſels and matter upon which the work is intended. Theſe are the general heads upon which the matter and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Furnaces is grounded; it followeth now, we ſhould ſay ſomething of their uſe, and the deſcription of their parts.</p>
                           <p>We begin by the Furnace commonly called an <hi>ATHANOR,</hi> which ſignifies a Furnace in <hi>Arabick,</hi> and hath this name given it by excellency, (the figure called by Orators <hi>Antonomaſia</hi>) becauſe this Furnace is not only the moſt uſefull of all others, to perform at the ſame time ſeveral Operations; but alſo becauſe it ſaves Coals, eaſeth the care and aſſiduity of the Artiſt, and yields a heat eaſie to be regulated. The <hi>Athanor</hi> is conſiſting of four parts: The firſt is the Turret, containing the Coals: The ſecond, a <hi>Balneum Maris:</hi> The third, an Aſh: The fourth, a Sand-fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace. The Turret is to have four or five foot in height, 1 ½ foot ſquare in the outſide, and ten inches of empty ſpace or diameter in the inſide. It requires an Aſh room, with its dore for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating the Air, and taking away the Aſhes, and a dore above the Grate, to cleanſe it, and take away the earth and little ſtones which are ſometimes mingled with the Coals, and would ſtop the Grate, and hinder the paſſage of Air, and conſequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the Fire. This Turret alſo muſt have three open places, each half a foot high, and three inches broad in the three other ſides of the Furnace above the Grate, that the heat may by that paſſage be communicated to the <hi>Balneum Maris,</hi> Aſh and Sand-Furnaces, which muſt be Contiguous to this Turret, and each
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170969:58"/>of theſe muſt alſo have their Aſh-hole, Grate, and Dore, to be (if occaſion requires) employed ſeverally by themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Turret: Theſe holes muſt be ſhut up, with Iron Plates, that are to riſe and fall, according to the degrees of fire to be given, to either of theſe Furnaces. To ſtop the top of the Turret, there may be fitted a round or ſquare braſs Kettle, which may be uſefull for ſeveral Operations, but ſpecially digeſtions: This Kettle or Cauldron ſhall be fitted, and joyn between two Iron bands, the one of which ſhall be even with the inſide of the Turret-top, and the other with the outſide, the ſpace between theſe two being filled with Aſhes to hinder the expiration of heat by the ſaid top; and thus the fire ſhall be forced to drive its heat to the ſides, drawn in by the Regiſters fitted to each of the three Furnaces. And ſo much ſhall ſuffice to give a ſhort explanation of the ſtructure and uſe of the <hi>Athanor:</hi> for as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the form and figure of it, the ingenuous Artiſt is left to his own liberty.</p>
                           <p>There is alſo a <hi>Diſtillatory Furnace</hi> requiſite in Chymical Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, to which the Copper body, or <hi>Veſica,</hi> is faſtened for the diſtilling of <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> or Spirits of Wine, and for other hot Spirits, which are extracted by the help of fermentation; alſo for the extraction of diſtilled Oyls, improperly called Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and after you have covered the ſaid body with its head, you muſt joyn to it a Fat or Barrell, with a ſtrait or crooked Pipe (called commonly a Worm) paſſing through the ſame, and receiving the vapours droven by the Fire, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed into Liquor in the Pipe, by the cold of Water where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Fat is to be filled.</p>
                           <p>For thoſe that will operate upon Minerals and Metals, a <hi>Furnace of Cementation</hi> or trying-Furnace is required, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a Round of bricks of one foot diameter in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and eight or nine inches high; wherein, after the firſt row of bricks is ſet, which by a good Lute and fire-proof, muſt exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be joyned and faſtened together, a hole muſt be left for the bellowes: This Furnace may alſo ſerve for Copell and Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                           <p>A Laboratory cannot be accounted compleat, without a <hi>Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratory Furnace,</hi> which is either cloſe or open; the cloſe is that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170969:59"/>in which, <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> and ſpirits of Salts, as Nitre, Vitriol, common Salt, and other things of like nature, may be diſtilled; the Open, is that which is uſed for Reverberation and Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the help of the flame refracted from the backſide to the mouth of the Furnace, drawn in by a gap of half an Inch broad, and of the length of the whole Furnace, left behinde the Iron Plate, which contains the matter to be reverberated; and the ſame flame ſo reflected, goes out by another gap of the ſame dimenſion, left in the fore-front of the Furnace at the top, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately under its Cover, which ought to be made flat without any Regiſter, except the ſame gap left open before.</p>
                           <p>Finally, to compleat all, the Artiſt muſt have his <hi>Winde-Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,</hi> for Mineral and Metallick fuſions, Vitrifications, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of <hi>Regula's;</hi> the Grate thereof muſt be placed upon a Square born by four Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>But becauſe Chymical Artiſts are not ſtill ſedentary, and ſo cannot be furniſhed, where they have occaſion to work, with all ſort of Furnaces, I will he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Build a Furnace of 1 ½ foot ſquare, make the bottom of the Aſh-room with a brick layd flat, and continue to raiſe the wall with two bricks, and leave the empty place in the middle, with
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170969:59"/>the dore before of four inches height, which are two bricks; then cover the dore with a brick, and compleat the ſquare with the ſame height: after this ſet a Grate conſiſting of ſeven Iron barres, of the thickneſſe of the thumb, ſquarely wrought: theſe barres muſt be laid upon their edge, that the aſhes may the eaſlier fall thorough, and not ſuffocate the fire; the diſtance between each muſt be of the fore-fingers breadth: and having thus placed them, and fitted their equal diſtance with Tyles broken, or ſtones of the ſame dimenſion and thickneſs, and luted all very well together; you muſt begin to build in a falling wall, leaving only ſix inches of your Grate open, and leſſening every lay of bricks of about three lines, which work is to be continued till you have brought it to be about ten inches high, which ſpace is neceſſary, as much to contain the Coals, as to leave a play ſufficient for the fire; you muſt leave here a dore alſo of the ſame dimenſion as the Aſh-room; this ended, place two Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barres of an inch thick, diſtant half a foot one from the other, and then eeven the wall either with ſtone, or ſome other matter of a fit thickneſſe, and then build round three bricks edge wiſe, that you may have the more room, to put the neceſſary Veſſels for the following Operations.</p>
                           <p>If you will work with the <hi>Balneum Maris,</hi> take a Kettle or round Cauldron of an equal diameter with the inſide of your Furnace, and of one foot height only, that it may the better be adapted to the Furnace, and the ſpace remaining at the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the ſquare, will be inſtead of Regiſters to draw, and enliven or remit the heat, according as there ſhall be occaſion. You muſt alſo have another Cauldron, with a good ſtrong bottom of Iron plate, but thinner in the ſides, made fit to be adapted to the ſame Furnace; and this will ſerve for diſtillations, and for works that require a heat either of Aſhes, Sand, or filings of Iron; and if this Iron Veſſel was made of Mettle of a Breſt-armour Plate, and forged all of one piece, it would alſo ſerve for a <hi>Balneum Maris.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And if you will work with a Retort, you may put an Earthen Pot Cover, turned upſidewards, upon the Grate; and fill the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of it with ſand, to be inſtead of a Lute, and hinder the breaking of the Veſſel, and the too quick action of the fire,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170969:60"/>upon it and the contained matter; after which you have no more to do, then to cover the top of the Furnace with an Earthen Pan not leaded, and bored with a hole in the middle, that this hole with the other four angles may be inſtead of a Regiſter to direct the fire.</p>
                           <p>If the Artiſt deſires to make uſe of this Furnace; towards Fuſion, Calcination, Cementation, or Reverberation, he may do it alſo, having taken away the bricks, builded edge-wiſe on the ſide-top of the Furnace, as the barres alſo, to put in his matter more eaſily and readily.</p>
                           <p>Thus much we had to ſay of Furnaces built with Lute and Bricks: there remains only now, to ſpeak ſomething of the <hi>Lamp-Furnace,</hi> uſed by the moſt curious Artiſts for many Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Operations. This Furnace muſt be made of a good <hi>Bolus</hi> and well compacted Clay, kneaded and well allayed together, and then well baked, that the heat of the Lamp may not tranſpire; and to hinder it the better, the Furnace may after baking be rubb'd and anointed within and without, with white of Eggs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Liquor by a continual agitation.</p>
                           <p>This Furnace is to conſiſt of three pieces, making in all 21 inches in height, of an inch thickneſs, and eight inches diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the inſide. The firſt piece, which is the baſis of the Furnace, muſt be eight inches high, with a hole of 4½ diameter below, that by this opening the Lamp may be put in, whoſe diameter is to conſiſt of three inches, and the depth or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavity of two: it muſt be round, and covered with an Iron plate, bored in the middle with a ſufficient hole to contain a link of 12 threds or more, and with ſix other holes round about, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned in an equal diſtance from that of the middle. The ſecond piece is to be of ſeven inches height, and fitted and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apted to the firſt, having four earthen jets or handles of about an inch long, ſpringing out of the Wall-work, to hold up an Earthen or Braſs Veſſel of ſix inches diameter, and four high, to make a <hi>Balneum Maris,</hi> or a <hi>Capſula</hi> for aſhes or ſand, as occaſion requires. There muſt alſo be in this ſecond piece or part of the Furnace two holes oppoſite the one to the other, of 1½ inch diameter, fitted with two Glaſſes of <hi>Venice</hi> Cryſtal: theſe two holes muſt be made between the height of the fourth
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170969:60"/>and laſt inch of the height, to be inſtead of windows, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thereby the better the various colours, in the Operations and Diſſolutions made by the Artiſt, oppoſing a lighted Candle to the ſide you are to look in the Veſſel in which the matter is contained, lying interpoſed. The third piece or part of the Furnace muſt be ſix inches high to compleat the total height of 21. made arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, or hemiſpherical, and bored on the top with a hole of an inch diameter, receiving ſeveral pieces of three lines apiece, growing ſtill narrower till they end in a pyramidal knob which ſhall cloſe up the laſt: There muſt alſo be four other like holes made between the height of three or four inches, equally diſtant one from the other: theſe holes are inſtead of Regiſters to the Lamp-Furnace, whoſe heat is alſo partly governed by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing or relenting, which the approach or removal of the flame in the Lamp doth cauſe, (whoſe ſupport muſt be made with a round piece of Wood, faſtened or applyed to a skrew, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it ſhall be raiſed or depreſſed at the will of the Artiſt,) as alſo by putting more or leſs wieks to burn in the Lamps; and augmenting or leſſening the number of threds in the wieks, the heat is multiplyed or leſſened, according to the nature of the Operations. But he that will proceed with more nicety in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the exact degrees of heat, muſt have recourſe to the <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer</hi> (commonly called <hi>A Weather-glaſſe</hi>) wherein the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter incloſed, doth by its raiſing and depreſſing, exactly ſhew the degrees of heat. The Oyl which is to be imployed for the feeding of this Lamp, may be rectified upon fixt Salts made by Calcination, that they may yield leſs Soot, and diſplay their action more vigorouſly, ſince that rectification takes away their excrementitious humour and ſuperfluity. The wieks muſt be made of Gold, <hi>Alumen plumae,</hi> or <hi>Amiantho's,</hi> which is a Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral found in the Iſland of <hi>Elba:</hi> to which in caſe of neceſſity may be ſubſtituted the Marrow or ſoft Cotton found in the middle of Elder, or Reed, very well dried; and this muſt be changed freſh every 24 hours: for which cauſe it is neceſſary to be provided with two Lamps, to ſucceed one the other, that no intermiſſion may interrupt the action of heat. If you make uſe of the marrow or heart of Elder, there muſt be a little ſharp piece of Iron, or a Wyer ſharpened, fixt and fodded in the bottom of the Lamp,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170969:61"/>that may anſwer the middle hole of the Cover which is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the wiek.</p>
                           <p>The figures of all theſe ſeveral Furnaces are exhibited in the Cut, following this Chapter. We add only two words concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Inſtruments neceſſary to the managing of the Furnaces, as Pincers and Tongs to take away the Crucibles, a crooked Scraper to cleanſe the Grates, an Iron Shovel to take the aſhes away: There muſt alſo be an Iron Conical and hollow Veſſel, well ſodded and ſtaunch, for projecting the <hi>Regula's,</hi> the Model whereof may be taken in the figures of Glaſs Veſſels.</p>

                           <p>HAving deſcribed the variety of Veſſels, and their uſe, as alſo the diverſity of Furnaces, it followeth we ſhould ſpeak of all the kindes of Lutations, both of Lutes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the fabrication of Furnaces, as of that which is uſed for the preſervation of Veſſels, and to repair their cracks and fractures, as alſo to joyn them again together.</p>
                           <p>That Lute which is fitteſt for the conſtruction of Furnaces, is to be made with red Clay: not too fat, leſt it be ſubject to chinks; nor too lean or ſandy, leſt it binde not enough. This Clay muſt be wrought in Water, wherein ſtore of Horſe-dung and Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-ſoot hath been ſteept and well mingled, by which a Salt is communicated to the water, binding the Clay, and making it fit to abide the Fire. But if you will make uſe of this kinde of Lute or Clay, to arm, or ſpread about the Glaſs or Earthen Veſſels, which are expoſed to the open Fire, you muſt add com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salt, or the <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> of <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> beaten or grinded Glaſs, and ſcales of Iron falling from the Anvil in Smiths Forges; and you ſhall have a Lute ſo reſiſting to the action of Fire, that it will be impenetrable to vapours, inſomuch as it will ſerve inſtead of the Retorts when the length and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170969:61"/>of flaming Fire, which is uſually given at the end of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Operations, hath melted the Glaſten ones.</p>
                           <p>When we have ſpoken of Veſſels, we have mentioned ſome that ought to be joyned together for one Operation, and ſaid that it is neceſſary, when the ſubſtances wrought upon are ſubtile, penetrating and aethereal, that their meeting may be very exactly luted. There are then three kindes of Lute obſervable, for the joyning of Veſſels together, when they are not expoſed to open fire. The firſt is, that Lute which is made with white of Eggs, beaten and reduced to water by a long agitation: therein dip Fillets of Linnen, and ſpread the powder of unſlackt Lime ſubtily beaten, then add another fillet of dipt Linnen, and ſpread pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der again, and ſo continue and re-iterate this three times; but note, that the Lime powder muſt never be mingled with the water of Eggs, becauſe the ſecret fire of the Lime would burn and harden it, though many Artiſts do fall into this error; you may alſo dip in the ſame Whites of Eggs, Swine or Ox Bladder, without making uſe of the Lime, principally in the rectification and alkoholiſation of fiery Spirits, extracted out of fermented ſubſtances. The ſecond kinde of Lute is made with white Starch or baked Flower, and made into Pappe with common water: this kinde of Lute ſuffices for luting Veſſels which contain leſs ſubtile and penetrating ſubſtances. The third, is nothing elſe but Paper cut in Fillets, folded and dipt in water, applyed to the top of <hi>Cucurbites,</hi> both to hinder that the head may not offend it, and prevent the exhaling of vapours. This manner of Lute is only uſed in evaporating and drawing of ſome inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Menſtruum</hi> or of ſmall worth, and which may not ſerve again for another Operation.</p>
                           <p>There muſt alſo be another kinde of ſtrong Lute, made to remedy the cracking of Veſſels, and joyn them together, when they are to ſuffer a violent heat; of this there is two ſorts. The firſt made with Glaſs reduced to very ſubtile powder, <hi>Karabe</hi> or yellow Amber and Borax, allayed with the Mucilage or water wherein Gum Arabick hath been ſteept, and ſo applyed to the joynts or meeting of the Veſſels or their Cracks: and after it is well dryed, you muſt run with a red hot Iron gently over it, and it will give it a faſt ſo dering and almoſt perfect union of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170969:62"/>chinks or cracks of the Veſſels together: But if you will ſpare ſo much trouble, make your Lute only with ſoft Cheeſe, Lime and Rye flower; and you ſhall finde it no leſs ſucceſſefull for this purpoſe by experience. But if you will cloſe the neck of a Retort, and fit it to its Recipient, for the diſtilling of <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> and Spirits of Salts, uſe only common Clay, and the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put Mortuum</hi> of Vitriol or <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> and common Salt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the Salt in water, and mixing well your Lute, then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to the place, give it time to drye with a ſlow heat, to avoyd chinks; which if any happen, your care muſt be to ſtop them leaſurely as they are made, and hinder thereby the exhaling of volatile Spirits.</p>
                           <p>To all theſe kinde of Lutations may very well be added the <hi>Hermetical Seal,</hi> which is nothing elſe but the melting of the Glaſs in the neck of the Veſſel, to which end the Artiſt is to give by degrees the heat of Fuſion; and when you ſee the neck begin to yield and encline by the force of fire melting the Glaſs, with ſtrong Cizzers ready for the purpoſe, you muſt cut the neck of the Veſſel where it is moſt melted; and thus the parts compreſſed, do as it were unite the edges of the Glaſs inſeparably: But if you would rather cloſe or ſeal the Veſſel in a ſharp end, twiſting by degrees the neck of the Veſſel, you muſt after expoſe the ſmall end to the flame of a Candle or Lamp, to frame thereby a little knob, wherewith that ſmall hole may be ſtopt, which moſt commonly remains at the end of the twiſting, and is almoſt imperceptible.</p>
                           <p>Now as the Veſſels are not ſtill framed according to our deſire, and that ſome parts are often to be taken away, which may hinder the Operations; we muſt alſo declare, how this, without endangering the Veſſel may be done, <hi>viz.</hi> by breaking or ſlitting the Glaſs equally by a thwart line: This is performed three ſeveral wayes; as either by applying a red hot Iron to begin the ſlit, or twiſting about the neck of the Veſſel three rowes of thred dipt in Brimſtone, if it be ſtrong and thick; or elſe turning the Veſſels part you would ſlit to the flame of a Lamp or Candle, if it be a thin and ſmall Glaſs; and when it is well heated by any of theſe three ways, wipe it off, and throw upon it ſome drops of cold water, which will cauſe a Crack; the which begun,

                              <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of ſuch Obſervations as are neceſſary for Separating and Purifying the firſt Five Subſtances, after they are drawn from the Mixts.</head>
                           <p>
                              <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRE is a potent agent, and an equivocal cauſe, which eaſily drives upwards, evaporable, ſublimeable, and volatile Subſtances, ſuch as are Phlegm, Spirit and Oyl. Phlegm, or the wateriſh part, becauſe it ſticks not very much to the other Principles, doth aſcend the firſt; and for this reaſon, there is but need of a ſlow fire to extract it, whereas for the Oyl a ſtronger is required, by reaſon of its clammineſs and viſcoſity, and its uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Salt; and for the Spirit, it requires yet a more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170969:64"/>fire, by reaſon of its waight, Spirits being nothing elſe but open Salts, as Salts exchangeably nothing but cloſed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted Spirits. Sometimes the Phlegm, Oyl, and Spirit, do confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly aſcend with much Salt, by the great violence and vehemency of Fire, and ſome time much of the Earth is alſo ſublimated with theſe Subſtances; as it may evidently appear in the Soot of Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, from which the ſeparation of the five Subſtances may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be made.</p>
                           <p>The Phlegm then, which is the firſt aſcending, may be ſeparated with the heat of a luke-warm Bath, or ſome other analogal heat; it may be ſevered from the Oyl, by the Funnel, becauſe it ſwims a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove: but from the Spirit it muſt be ſeparated by the heat of <hi>Balne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um maris,</hi> or ſome ſuch like: for, that heat is capable to elevate the Phlegm, but cannot drive upwards the Spirit by reaſon of its waight; to that ſublimation a ſtronger fire is required, as that of aſhes, ſand, or filings, or ſome quicker heat, according to the nature of the Spirit.</p>
                           <p>The Salt and Earth are not very ſtrictly united, wherefore they may eaſily be ſeparated by the help of ſome aqueous liquor, which is the fitteſt <hi>Menſtruum</hi> to diſſolve Salts, and ſeparate them from the Earth: and as the Earth by its nature is indiſſoluble, it precipitates it ſelf into the bottom by its own weight: The Salt being thus ſeparated, the Lye muſt be filtrated, and the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi> evaporated in Glaſſen Veſſels, White-Earth, or Jugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metal till it skins, then expoſe them to the cold to make it ſhute into Cryſtals, and ſo incloſe it in Glaſſen Veſſels well ſtopt, to hinder their melting, by the attraction of the moiſture of the Air.</p>
                           <p>But you are to note, that the fiery, or hot Spirits, drawn from fermented Subſtances, are lighter yet then the Phlegm, and ſo aſcend the firſt in their diſtillation or rectification. A very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and remarkable example is obvious in the making of Wine: for, if you take it to diſtil in the Muſt before it hath fermented, nothing but Phlegm will aſcend, and the Spirit ſhall remain, joyned and incorporated with the eſſential ſalt of liquor, which ſhal thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en into an extract very ſweet and pleaſant: But, if you ſtay your Diſtillation after the Fermentation is perfected in the Cellar, you ſhall draw firſt the hot burning Spirit, which the Phlegm ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170969:64"/>and in the bottom nothing ſhall remain, but an ungrateful and unſavoury extract, becauſe the eſſential Salt of the Muſt, hath been volatilized into Spirit by the action of the fermentation.</p>
                           <p>The difference of Veſſels and ſeveral degrees of Fire, are alſo very uſeful to ſeparate and joyn again theſe ſeveral ſubſtances, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have ſeparated aſſunder: for the bond of their union being once broken, each takes its place by it ſelf; but the fire intervening, reduces all into vapours and exhalations, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diverſity of Subſtances are received by the Artiſt in ſeveral Veſſels. Thus is the Spirit eaſily ſeparated from the the Oyl by the funnel, whether it ſwims on the top, as the Oyls of Flowers and Seeds are uſed to do; or whether it ſinks in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, as doth the Oyl extracted from aromatick Subſtances and Woods, But nothing but a great and violent heat can ſeparate the Salt from the Spirit, by reaſon of the great ſympathy they have together; when it is noted, that Salts muſt be made uſe of in the fixing of Spirits, and Spirits reciprocally to volatilize Salts.</p>
                           <p>From what we have already ſaid above, every one may of himſelf make ſeveral fine reflections and conſiderations, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſtillation of Mixts abounding in Salt, Spirit, or Oyl, or any other mediane Subſtance between theſe three. But it muſt be noted, in general, that Animals and their parts require in the operations made upon them, only a very ſlow heat, becauſe they are compounded of a very Volatile Oyl and Spirit; and that Vegetables and their parts need a heat of a more exalted degree, according to their more or leſs affixation; but Minerals, and chiefly all the family of Salts, require the greateſt and intenſeſt hear.</p>
                           <p>When the Oyls and Spirits aſcend with the other Subſtances confuſedly together, they muſt be rectified, that is to ſay, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by a re-iterated diſtillation. But a ſlow and gentle fire draws eaſily away, and ſeparates aſunder the Phlegm and the Salt: the Salt hides himſelf in the boſom of the Earth, and forſakes it not till the Spirit and Oyl be ſeparated by augmentation of fire, which by the violence of its action diſunites finally the compound, and that done, there muſt be water poured upon the Earth (common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and improperly enough called the <hi>Caput mortuum</hi>) to diſſolve
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170969:65"/>and ſeparate the Salt: which done, you are to evaporate the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum,</hi> &amp; in the bottom of the Veſſel, you ſhall find are tranſparent and Cryſtalline Salt, if the Salt be an Eſſential Salt which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtil the nature of niter, provided you leave a portion of Phlegm, that the Cryſtals may ſhoot therein: but, if the Salt be an <hi>Alkali</hi> made by Calcination, you muſt evaporate Phlegm dry, and you ſhall find the Salt in the bottom in the form of an opacous and friable ſtone.</p>
                           <p>All theſe Obſervations are very neceſſary to be noted in the practical part, becauſe oftentimes the Artiſt hath need but of one of theſe Subſtances ſeparated from the others: therefore he muſt be skilful in ſeparating the one from the other according to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion, becauſe the deſired and lookt for operation is often miſſed, and impedited by a connexion of the aſſociated principles, when they are yet joyned one to another: for one part of the Mixt may be aſtringent and coagulating, when the other ſhall be inciſive and aſtringent, according to the variety of principles that compound the ſame: and theſe parts ſo joyned together, are hurtful, and contrary one to the other, ſo that when you intend to diſſolve, you muſt know, and be capable to ſeparate the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving principle by it ſelf, as you muſt reciprocally take the coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating principle to coagulate.</p>
                           <p>The firſt Diſtillations are ever tainted with ſome impurities, and for the moſt part have a touch and ſavour of <hi>Empyreuma,</hi> chiefly thoſe that without addition of any <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> are made with the heat of a violent fire: as the Oyls drawn by a retort, which are thick and filled with ſome portion of the Volatile Salt of the Mixt, and ſometimes of the fixt Salt driven up by the extreme action of fire. Therefore an Artiſt muſt be skilled in ſeparating theſe different parts; ſo, if the extracted Oyl be filled with theſe impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or hath acquired an Empyreumatical odour, it muſt be rectified upon <hi>Alkalis,</hi> ſuch as are Tartar, or Vine-aſhes, or aſhes of any Wood; for, the ſympathy which is between Salts, will cauſe them to joyn together; or to ſpeak more Philoſophically, the fixt Salts will kill the volatile by their action, they being commonly ſharp and acid, and ſo ſhall the Oyl aſcend clear, ſubtile, defeca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and without that ſmoaky Odour, which the Volatile Salt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries along with it, as a kind of ſmoak: And if the firſt Rectification
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170969:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>be not ſufficient, it ſhall be reiterated upon other Salts, or upon that which hath already been uſed, provided it be before hand made red hot in a Crucible, to take away from it, that ill o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and impurity which it had contracted in the firſt Rectifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                           <p>The impurities of Spirits muſt be ſeparated by rectifying them upon Earths deprived of all Salt, or upon Aſhes, whoſe Salt ſhall be waſht away by Lyes: becauſe, if you did rectifie them, upon bodies that were impregnated with any Salt, the Salt ſhould fix and keep to it ſelf ſome part of the Spirit; or, if the Spirit was ſtronger, it would Volatilize the Salt, and carry it along with it by Sublimation, becauſe of their mutual ſympathy which binds and unites them very ſtrictly together.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe that have been ignorant of this doctrine of Action, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, and the ſeveral Fermentations incident to Chymiſtry, by the means and mixture of Salts and Spirits, have groſsly erred and committed irreparable faults, as it may be obſerved in the reading of Chymical Practitioners.</p>
                           <p>Volatile Salts may be purified by diſſolving them in their own Spirits, after which they muſt be filtrated to ſeparate their heterogeneous Subſtances, and then drive them through low Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbits or Retorts with a wide neck: and thus ſhall two opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be performed at once, by rectifying the Spirit, and ſubliming the Volatile Salt, which is nothing elſe but a coagulated Spirit, or a mean ſubſtance between Salts and Spirits, by the mixture of a ſmall portion of internal Sulphur of the Mixt whence it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.</p>
                           <p>Concerning Eſſential Salts, ſuch as thoſe which are extracted out of green and juycy Plants, where Nitre or Tartar are predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, which contain in themſelves the principles in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Eſſence and chief virtue of the Mixt, they muſt be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified either with diſtilled Rain-water, or the water diſtilled from the juyces of the ſame Plants; then percolate thoſe diſſolutions through common Aſhes, or ſuch as will be made, by calcining the Cakes of the Plants remaining after the juyce is drawn: that it may be inſtead as it were of a filtration, to remove the terreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triety and clammineſs, which might hinder the Cryſtallizing of the Salts; then evaporate what is percolated to a fourth part
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170969:66"/>of the whole, and expoſe it in a Veſſel in the cold, that the Saline ſubſtance contained in the liquor may ſhoot in Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals.</p>
                           <p>As for the Salts, <hi>Alkali</hi> or Fixt; made by Calcination, they muſt be purified by reverberating the Aſhes, until they become gray or whitiſh, then make a Lye thereof, filtrate it, and evaporate, till it be dry; and if it be the Salt of any Plant diſtilled, reiterate the diſſolution of that firſt Salt in the proper water of that Plant, that the Spiritual and Eſſential Salt of that Plant which is in the water, may joyn with the fixt Salt, which ſhall be as a <hi>Magns</hi> to it, and encreaſe its vertue; as alſo it will hinder the ſaid Salt from melting ſo eaſily when expoſed to the open Air, as it would otherwiſe; the Salt having been thus prepared, muſt be expoſed in the cold to Cryſtallize, after evaporation hath been made, till a skin covers the liquor: but if it be a Lye only, it muſt be evaporated, till it be dry, having firſt been filtrated.</p>
                           <p>From all that is ſaid above, it may eaſily be conceived, that no labour nor care is to be ſpared, to ſeparate and purifie all theſe divers Subſtances, ſince it is abſolutely neceſſary; leſt the one ſhould prove oppoſite and contrary to the other, and ſo hinder the uſe and operations of our moſt noble Remedies, according to the true Indications of Phyſick: for theſe Subſtances being joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yet together, do often more hurt and prejudice then they do ſervice: and this mixture doth hinder, that the Preparation doth not operate (as we do intend) according to the extent of the Salts vertue, or of the Oyl and Spirit, becauſe the faculty and vertue of one of theſe things, is blunted and depreſſed, by the Viſcoſity or the drought of the other. And all theſe general hints and directions may be applyed to all Chymical Preparations, which are not only made upon Animals and Vegetables, but alſo upon Minerals; and as much for thoſe that work upon Metals, as for thoſe which only ſeek Remedies for the ennobling of Phyſick; or ſuch as only work for ſatisfaction of their Curioſity, and the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and examination of Phyſical Truths.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> An Apology in the behalf of Chymical Remedies.</head>
                           <p>I Thought it neceſſary to vindicate the Profeſſors of this noble Art, from the calumnies and aſperſions which ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do caſt upon it, before I come to deſcribe the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of thoſe Remedies which are uſed by true Phyſitians; to arm with Reaſons and defenſive Arguments the Lovers of this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, againſt the weakneſs of their Adverſaries. I ſay, that theſe deſpiſers of Chymiſts, and haters of Chymiſtry, are ignorant: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not only unacquainted with the true Preparation and Effects of theſe Remedies; but moreover ignorant in the knowledge of Nature and its Operations, which only can be diſcovered by thoſe that work upon natural Products, and do exactly and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Anatomize all the parts which they contain in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                           <p>But before we come to quote the reaſons of both parties, <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> and <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> in the controverſie between them; we muſt before all things, find a competent and capable Judge to decide the Queſtion: that is to ſay, a Judge that may be throughly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their Opinions. For it would not be poſſible for a <hi>Galeniſt,</hi> to blame and lawfully refute the Theory and Practiſe of Chymiſtry, unleſs he be fully acquainted with their doctrine.</p>
                           <p>But, that no body may be ſcandalized at our Diſcourſe, you muſt know, that there is a great difference between the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> and the Doctrine of <hi>Galen;</hi> and that Chymiſtry doth not undervalue this Author, knowing very well, with what deſire he was poſſeſt to attain to the knowledge of this Art, having with great avidity and longing ſought for that Art, which ſhould teach him how to ſeparate the ſeveral Subſtances, of which Mixts are compoſed. But many at this day do profeſs, and take upon themſelves the name of <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> which never were acquainted with his works; and boaſtingly pretend to follow the Doctrine of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> which never did examine his practiſe. We muſt then call <hi>Galeniſts</hi>
                              <pb n="108" facs="tcp:170969:67"/>thoſe which are only Phyſitians by name, and who after they have peruſed ſome Univerſity Writings, which do perſwade them, that, Phyſick is nothing elſe but an art of diſcerning heat and cold, immediately take upon themſelves the practice, and fill their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes with nothing elſe but notions of Heat and Cold; and all their skill tends to ſpeak upon the more or leſs of theſe qualities. But the learned <hi>Fernelius,</hi> who was the Ornament of his Age, doth confeſs and evidence, after having acknowledged this Error, that beſides theſe firſt qualities, there are many other vertues hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Mixts, as it evidently doth appear towards the end of his ſecond Book, <hi>De abditis Rerum Cauſis,</hi> where he teaches how the Seminal Vertue contained in Compounds, and which really is the ſeat of all their activity, muſt be extracted.</p>
                           <p>We muſt then take for judge of this Controverſie <hi>Peripatetick Philoſophy,</hi> provided it be ſeaſoned with the noble knowledge both of <hi>Galenical</hi> and <hi>Chymical Phyſick,</hi> that none may be judge and party in the ſame caſe; to this end, all prejudices which might be entertained concerning either of theſe Arts, muſt be laid aſide, and ſubmitted to the trial of Reaſon, which is the Touch-ſtone by which the truth or falſity of all Learning is diſcovered.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> ſuch as we have ſpoken of above, do firſt blame the Remedies prepared by Chymical Art, for three reaſons: The firſt, becauſe theſe Remedies cannot be wrought but by Fire. The ſecond, becauſe they are extracted from Minerals. And the third, becauſe their Action is too violent. To theſe heads, we anſwer in order, and ſay firſt, That if whatſoever paſſes through fire, and cannot be prepared but by it, was to be blamed, it would go ill againſt the Cooks, who without it can dreſs no meats; and thoſe very Apothecaries, which according to their Preſcriptions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their Medicaments, would ſtand in oppoſition to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. Secondly, that all Chymical Remedies are not extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Minerals; though it may objected to them, that they uſe them in their own Diſpenſatories; but that the greateſt and beſt part of the choyſelt Chymical Remedies are taken from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Vegetables and Animals. And for the third point, we ſay, That if any Chymical Remedies have a violent action, and the Chymical Phyſitian doth make uſe of them in deſperate and refractory diſeaſes, he doth nothing in this caſe, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
                              <pb n="109" facs="tcp:170969:67"/>hath not done, who made frequent uſe of Hellebore, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenteſt of all Vegetables: If they object, that this great Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian made uſe of this Remedy only for want of a better; it may be as rationally anſwered again, that Chymical Phyſitians nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do uſe theſe violent Remedies, but in deſperate Diſeaſes, and that becauſe <hi>Extremis morbis extrema remedia conveniunt.</hi> To ſay, that all Chymical Remedies are violent, is an aſſertion of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; for Chymical Artiſts do prepare them with ſo neat and in ſo neceſſary a manner, that they become by it pleaſanter to the taſte, more ſalutiferous to the body, and leſs hurtful in their operations. And it is in this properly, That Chymical <hi>Pharmacy</hi> doth differ from the <hi>Galenick,</hi> which prepares alſo in a manner Medicaments, and doth pretend to correct the vices and violence thereof; but not with that requiſite nicety and perfection, as to ſeparate Purity from Impurity, and Homogeneous from Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Subſtances. For, who will not confeſs, that a Patient will rather take ſome few grains of Magiſtery of Jalap, or a Pill of ſome Panchymagogical Extract; or finally, a very ſmall doſis of well prepared Mercury, which may be wrapt in ſome Conſerves pleaſing to the taſt, or delicate Jelleys, or finally, be diſſolved in ſome pleaſant Liquor, then to ſwallow a <hi>Bolus</hi> of five or ſix <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> of <hi>Caſſia,</hi> or double <hi>Catholicon:</hi> that he will more reſolutely take three or four grains of ſome Sudorifical Specifick, as Bezoard Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, then to ſwallow a full glaſs of ſome Therical Diſſolution, or <hi>Opiatum Salomonis:</hi> That he will look with a better Eye upon a Broth wherein 1 ℈ of Vitriolated Tartar ſhall be diſſolved, then a great Glaſs of <hi>Apozem,</hi> or ſome Magiſterial Syrup after the old way, the Receipts or Preſcriptions whereof are commonly of the length of one foot and a half.</p>
                           <p>But it will be moreover objected, That although Chymiſts do cry up the ſweetneſs and pleaſantneſs of their Remedies; they muſt nevertheleſs confeſs, that there is in them more danger then in others, becauſe they are extracted from Minerals. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that many Remedies in Chymiſtry are taken from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Minerals: But for all this, it muſt not, nor cannot be granted, that they are venemous, or contrary to the nature of Mans-Body, and to affirm it, is the height of ignorance. For if ancient Phyſitians, have uſed them raw, as they were, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170969:68"/>out any Preparation, as may be ſeen in <hi>Galen, Dioſcorid, Pliny,</hi> and ſeveral other Authors; If modern <hi>Galeniſts</hi> have alſo imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, as <hi>Rondeletius,</hi> which in his Pills againſt the Pox uſes crude Mercury; <hi>Mathiolus</hi> who hath put in practice Antimony, which by excellency he calleth <hi>Manus Dei; Geſnerus</hi> hath done the ſame with Vitriol; <hi>Fallopius</hi> with the filings of Steel; and <hi>Riolanus,</hi> and many others, with Brimſtone, for Diſeaſes of the Lungs: Why ſhall Chymiſts be debarred from the ſame Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, after they have prepared, corrected, and deveſted them from the malignity and venom which they did contain, by the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of Purity from Impurity? which is much a better way then the pretended correction of <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> who indeavour to mitigate the vices and malignity of Mixts, uſed by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and Moderns alſo, by the addition of ſome other Subſtance, which may have, and really hath, in it ſelf its particular Vice and Impurity: as it is obvious in Hellebore, Spurge, Scamony, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quint or bitter Gourd, Agarick, and ſome others, which they pretend to correct by a ſimple addition of Maſtick, Cynamon, Cloves, Gum Dragant, and Ginger. But to ſhow the manifeſt difference between this Correction and that of Chymiſts; we may uſe the vulgar compariſon of an unskilful Cook, which to dreſs a ſavoury and delicate diſh of Tripes, ſhould think it enough to boyl them with odoriferous Herbs and good ſents, without waſhing and clenſing them from their inward filth.</p>
                           <p>Again, the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> will inſtance, and ſay, that Chymical Remedies, by reaſon of their ſharpneſs and acrimony, are not to be truſted. But to that we anſwer, That if the uſe of ſharp things muſt be baniſhed from Phyſick, it muſt with more reaſon be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in Food, and ſo conſequently all diſhes and ragouts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Salt, Vinegar, Verjuyce, Leek, Onion, Muſtard, Pepper, and all other kind of Spices are Ingredients, muſt be excluded from the Kitching uſe, as well as many Medicines blotted out of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotaries. Neither do they perceive, that by this argument, they thwart <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf, who hath placed Cantharides among mortal Medicaments, by reaſon of their corroſion, particularly upon the Bladder; he doth notwithſtanding ordain them, and ſo do his Sectators preſcribe them, though in ſome ſmall quantity, in ſome convenient liquor, to provoke Urine; to which end and purpoſe he doth highly commend them.</p>
                           <pb n="111" facs="tcp:170969:68"/>
                           <p>The ſame do Chymiſts uſe to do, who give their ſharp Remedies in ſome proper and ſpecifical Liquor, to produce ſuch Effects as they hope from their Medicaments. But to ſtop fully the <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> mouth, we muſt prove that they uſe in their common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, though Empirically, Chymical Remedies, whether they be natural, or artificial, as for Example: Do they not make uſe of crude Steel and Mercury, and many more natural Mixts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preparation? Do they not uſe Spirit of Vitriol, Spirit of Sulphur, Mineral Cryſtal, Cremor and Cryſtals of Tartar, <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> aperitive and aſtringent, Salt of Vitriol, <hi>Saccharum Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> or Sugar of Saturn? And though moſt of them be unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Antimony, and the true time and method of exhibiting this admirable Remedy; yet nevertheleſs do they give it in ſtealth to their Patients, diſguiſing it oftentimes with ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Senne, or ſome portion of their ordinary Pills; for they mix Emetick Wine in their Infuſions, and Emetick Powder in their Pills. But, that which is yet more to be noted, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is, That when <hi>Galeniſts</hi> by the obſtinacy of the Diſeaſe, are at a ſtand, and can no longer find in their method a Remedy to cure, and eradicate the evil of it, becauſe they never attained to the perfect knowledge of it, they uſe to ſend their Patients for a laſt refuge, to Baths and Mineral Springs: which practice of theirs, makes them tacitely to confeſs, that there is in Minerals a more potent, penetrative and active Vertue, then in any other of thoſe Remedies, which they did put in practice before.</p>
                           <p>This Truth is further confirmed by thoſe Remedies which Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions do daily uſe with very good ſucceſs, being for the moſt part compounded of Metals and Minerals; but thoſe principally which do work with more efficacy. It is true, that Chymiſts do likewiſe ſend their Patients to Mineral waters, and enjoyn them the uſe of them: But there is this difference, between them and <hi>Galeniſts;</hi> that the firſt are diſtinctly acquainted with the Sulphur, Salt or Spirit, which predominates in the Waters by them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; which the others do not, having but a confuſed and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial knowledge of the Vertue reſiding and hidden in theſe waters; and preſcribing them only, becauſe others have uſed them before, not being capable to ratiocinate upon the Effects by them produced, much leſs to prove the Efficient Internal
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170969:69"/>cauſes of the ſame; ſince it belongs properly to the ſearch of Chymiſts, whoſe peculiar work it is, to anatomize Mineral Waters, and demonſtrate what Fire, or Volatile Subſtances, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them: And if the ingenious Artiſt finds not himſelf fully ſatisfied with examining the Waters, he muſt further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his inquiſition in working upon the Earths adjacent to thoſe Mineral Spirits, and endeavour to diſcover what Metal moſt abounds in the <hi>Marcaſſites</hi> growing about that place: that done, it will be eaſie for him to find what Salt, or what Spirit is the moſt fitting to diſſolve that Metal, and to unite and mix it ſo indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly as it is, with the water: and being thus inſtructed, he can never fail to aſſign pertinent and demonſtrative reaſons both of the effects and cauſe of the vertue and efficacy of thoſe Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. If it be anſwered, that <hi>Galeniſts</hi> do alſo give the reaſons of ſuch effects, and aſſign them to the Salt, Sulphur, or Spirit predominant in theſe Waters; I reply, that they ſhall never ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfie a curious inquiſitor and ſearcher of truth in Nature, by their reaſons taken from the Doctrine of the Schools: But, that they muſt have borrowed this light from Chymical Authors, and ſo far they are no more a <hi>Galenical</hi> Doctrine; ſince they reaſon only upon the grounds, and by the Organs of Herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Philoſophy. Let us then conclude in the behalf of Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Remedies, and ſay, that they are the true weapons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a Phyſitian muſt arm himſelf to conquer and extirpate the moſt ſtubborn and rebellious Diſeaſes; and even ſuch as are held incurable by the ordinary Remedies of <hi>Galenical</hi> Phyſick; and ſo we conclude this ſhort Apology in the behalf of Chymical Remedies, whoſe wonderful nature it is, ever to act <hi>Citiùs, Tuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ùs, &amp; Jucundiùs.</hi>

                              <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Faculties of Mixts, and the ſeveral degrees of their Qualities.</head>
                           <p>AFter all we have ſaid above, we are to conſider what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit we can reap, by ſeparating the five Principles which may be extracted out of Compounds, to exalt the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Faculties of Remedies, and qualifie them with conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and various degrees according to their nature. Having then diſtinguiſhed the various Subſtances, which an Artiſt may extract out of Natural Bodies, and having taken notice, that ſome of them do more or leſs abound with Sulphur, Salt, Spirit, Earth, or Phlegm and that theſe five Subſtances are found in all the Mixts of the three Families of Nature, which are Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals: It ſeemeth that ſomething may be lawfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated in Phyſick for the uſe of it, and diſcovery of ſuch ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and ſpecifical qualities, as are proper to each of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, extracted out of the Mixt Bodies. For, as Vulgar or Dogmatical Phyſick hath attributed all, to the ſeveral degrees of firſt and ſecond Qualities: we muſt in this Chapter open the true knowledge of the ſpecifical vertues of each principle of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, that what we ſhall here deliver, may ſerve for an Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the better underſtanding of thoſe Authors, who hitherto have written thereof; for it may be ſecurely affirmed, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever abounds in Oyl, participates of the qualities of Oyl, and ſo of the Spirit and other conſtitutive parts. We might alſo inſert here a Catalogue of all the Mixts, wherein Sulphur is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; as alſo of the Compounds, where the other Principles do abound. We could likewiſe Anatomize all Natural Bodies, to know preciſely in what <hi>doſis</hi> or proportion they poſſeſs either of the five Principles, and how Nature hath diſtributed them to every one in particular, and having perfected ſuch a work, we mought very well bragge, of a diſtinct and abſolute knowledge of the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all natural things. But, as it is not only a work above the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170969:70"/>extent of any one ſingle mans life; and even that many Artiſts put together were not ſufficient for it; and that beſides this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, many Volumes would be of too narrow a compaſs to contain the Notes of ſuch Experiments: we will content our ſelves, to ſpeak only ſomething of it by the by, when we come to the deſcription of the work which may be done upon each Mixt, not exceeding the limits firſt propounded to our ſelves in the delineation of this Abridgement.</p>
                           <p>To return then to our ſeveral Degrees of Qualities of Mixts, or the five Subſtances which may be extracted out of them: We ſay firſt, that Oyl doth heat, or perform its operation by the means of heat, which is a more excellent Quality then that which is ſtiled Elementary. As for Example, We ſee by a common and familiar Experiment to all, that if the Oyl, or Aethereal Spirit of the Wine, which is its ſulphureous part, be ſeparated from its Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt, exalted by Fermentation, which we vulgarly call <hi>Aqua vitae;</hi> that which remains hath no heating faculty left, and is quite unapt to communicate any part more of that Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which we do attribute to Oyls and Spirits; but, if you joyn again this portion of Aetherial Oyl, or Spirit to its Phlegm or watery part, you ſhall reſtore it immediately to its capacity of heating which it had before; which makes us to conclude, that the more a Mixt doth abound in Aetherial Oyl, and Volatile Spirit, the more is it fit to impart heat, ſtrengthen and encreaſe our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as being more analogous and correſpondent to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our vital Spirits, as alſo of the Animals, becauſe this only portion of the Mixt is able to be conveyed and paſs to the laſt digeſtions.</p>
                           <p>The ſame judgement may be made alſo of all the family of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables; for we may ſay confidently, that the different parts of Plants have divers Degrees of Qualities, according as they have been more or leſs fermented, digeſted and concocted by the external heat of the Sun, concurring with their internal and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential, which is contained in their Salt, which is as the rind and cover of their fermenting and digeſtive Spirit; and according as this Salt is exalted, by the actions of theſe two efficient cauſes, the parts of the Plants do participate of more or leſs efficacy. So is the firſt place aſſigned to the Seed of the Plant,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170969:70"/>becauſe it is exalted to its perfection, and contains in it ſelf, that germinative and ſpermatick Spirit, which is capable to produce and multiply it ſelf into its like; and that in the body of the Seed Nature hath likewiſe gathered, concocted, digeſted and concentra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the Salt, Sulphur and Spirit of the Body of the Plant; as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Diſtillation of Seeds from which a great quantity of Volatile Salt is extracted, which is nothing elſe but the three Principles volatilized and united together, by the Internal heat of the Plant, and the External of the Sun: and in this Volatile Salt it is, that the vertues of all things lye hidden, which hath given occaſion to <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> to call them the <hi>General Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of the <hi>Arcana.</hi> Thence muſt we by degrees deſcend to know by divers ſteps the qualities of the other parts of Plants, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Ratiocination we have already made upon the Seed, for in the Flower there is leſs vertue then in the Seed, in the Leaf leſs then in the Flower, and in the Wood leſs then the Rind; and the Fruit is better then the Leaf, and ſo of the other parts of the Vegetable, which all are to be eſteemed according as they do abound in Oyl, Spirit, Eſſential or Volatile Salt. But we muſt digreſs a little here, to note a difference which is between the annual and laſting Plants: for ſome have the ſeat of their vertue placed in the root, the others in the leaf, and moſt in the Seed; therefore all theſe circumſtances are to be weighed, to make a right and ſolid judgement thereof, and to examine them by the external ſenſes and ratiocination, and make the choyce thereof accordingly.</p>
                           <p>All what we have ſaid above, may alſo be applyed to the other Principles, for diſtinguiſhing the Degrees of their Faculties; for if, by Example, a Mixt be deprived of its Salt, it ſhall loſe its deſiccative, deterſive, coagulative faculty, and all other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties proceeding from, or depending upon Salt. Now it is poſſible, that one Mixt compared to the other, may have two, three, four or five times more or leſs of Salt, Spirit, Sulphur, Phlegm or Earth, according to which the riſe and rule muſt be taken, for ſubdividing the Degrees of its Faculties; when the Artiſt ſhall have diſcovered by his work, the exceſs or defect of what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the vertues of Natural Bodies, that being yet hidden from our knowledge either by the neglect of Writers, or the ignorance
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170969:71"/>of thoſe Mongrel Phyſitians, which neither knew their Mother, nor the Children of her Womb: for we ſee that the juyce of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, Oranges, Limons, common and diſtilled Vinegar, the Spirit of Vitriol, common Salt, Nitre, Tartar, and many more like, do deſerve to have ſeveral Degrees of Qualities attributed to them, conſidering their eminent actions, which proceed from the exceſs or defect of ſome Principle more or leſs depurated; by which it doth appear, that Mixts have more or leſs of efficacy, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and vertue, according as the Efficient Principles are more or leſs in them; wherefore we may with very good ground and reaſon ſeek in Chymiſtry a ſolid foundation, for encreaſing the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Variety of Phyſick; correct the vulgar Pharmacy, ready to fall to decay; and examin throughly the practiſe of common Phyſitians.</p>

                           <p>THE order to be obſerved in the deſcription of the five Principles extracted from Mixt Bodies by Chymical Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, may be given two ſeveral wayes: for there may be firſt compiled in a Treatiſe all the Waters, either ſimple or compounded, according to their ſeveral kinds, as alſo the Oyls in another, and ſo of the Salt, and likewiſe each other of the Principles. Secondly, Theſe Subſtances may be deſcribed in the ſame Order, as their Extraction out of the Individual Bodies of Nature is performed. This laſt method we intend to follow, as that which ſatisfies better the mind of the Inquiſitor, and breeds leſs confuſion. We ſhall then accordingly give to each Mixt in particular a chapter by it ſelf, wherein we ſhall give an exact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the nature of the Mixt; and of all the Chymical Operations uſeful and neceſſary to Phyſick: forgetting nothing
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170969:71"/>of what may conduce to the exact information of the Artiſt, in exactly and curiouſly anaromizing the Mixt upon which he doth intend his Operation, untill he hath ſeparated all the ſeveral parts wherewith Nature hath endowed it.</p>
                           <p>And to proceed more methodically, we ſhall begin by Meteors, wherein we are to ſpeak of Rain, Dew, Honey, Wax, and B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then we follow ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Vegetables; where we will teach, how the parts of that rich and numerous Family are to be anatomiz'd; and finally, end by Minerals, examining the contents of Stones Salts, Marcaſſites, and Metals, whereof we ſhall ſeparate the hardeſt, and fixeſt parts, to draw from thence thoſe wonderfull Remedies, which are lockt up in the Center of thoſe true fruits of the Earth.</p>

                           <p>AS Chymiſts can neither extract nor diſſolve, without ſome fitting and convenient Liquor, adapted to the nature of thoſe Subſtances whereof the vertue is deſired (this Liquor Artiſts do commonly call their <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and this word being the moſt proper and beſt known, we will only make uſe of in all the Operations we are to deſcribe) as (I ſay) Chymiſts can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form no Operation without their <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> ſo hath their care and invention, much laboured to finde out one, which ſhould be deveſted of all particular qualities, and agreeable to all ſorts of Mixts, beſides the particular <hi>Menſtrues</hi> which they poſſeſs, and which are deſtinated for the extraction and diſſolution of ſome particular Subſtances and Compounds. The Sons of A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>t, upon this account, have thought no Subſtance to be more conducible to their end, then that which is the pureſt and moſt ſimple in Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> Dew and Rain water; both containing in themſelves
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170969:72"/>the Univerſal Spirit, and capable to yield their univerſal <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum,</hi> fit for extracting the vertues of things, and to be ſeparated again from them, without robbing or depriving them of any part of their vertue and excellency; provided theſe two Liquors be well and duely prepared.</p>
                           <p>It is needleſs to repeat that Dew and Rain are two Meteors, ſince we have already ſpoken of it, in the firſt part of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: It will ſuffice to ſay, that Rain-water muſt be gathered from the beginning to the twentieth of <hi>March,</hi> (or eight dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Equinoxe,</hi> and eight dayes after) becauſe then the Air is all filled and impregnated with thoſe true heavenly ſeeds that are deſtinated to the renewing of all natural productions; and when the water hath been elevated from the earth, and deprived of the ſeveral ferments wherewith the divers generations made within and without her Womb, had filled her, ſhe doth fall again through the Air, where ſhe is furniſhed anew with a pure Spirit, undetermined to all things, and fit to aſſume any ſhape. And ſo much ſhall ſuffice, to ſhew the neceſſity of chooſing the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> time, for gathering of the Rain-water.</p>
                           <p>Gather then about this time great ſtore of Rain-water, and leave it in a great wooden Tub or Veſſel very clean, in an open place, and free to the Air, and there let it ferment, to make a Sediment of the moſt groſs Impurities, which it might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the roofs and gutters of houſes, or other conveyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces through which it paſſes, and is conveyed unto us; it ſhall yield moreover a kind of skin or froth above, which perfects its depuration; after this fill, therewith great ſtone-Bottles, Glaſs-Veſſels, or Casks, if you will keep any as it is then, being then even ſo, fit for many Operations, and more uſefull then any other kind of water whatſoever, as we ſhall make appear in the ſequel of our practice; for it is of a more ſubtile nature then other waters, and abounds with a ſpiritual Salt, the only capable Agent to penetrate well into the Mixts.</p>
                           <p>But if you will ſubtilize more this water, and render it more capable to extract the tincture and vertues of things, you muſt diſtill it through the Worm, as you do Spirit of Wine, and draw only the two third parts of what your Veſſel contains, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterating this Diſtillation, by diminiſhing ſtill proportionably,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170969:72"/>till from a hundred pints you have but ten, which will afterwards ſerve to the extraction of purgative Subſtances.</p>
                           <p>The ſame may be done with Dew, which is to be preferred to Rain-water; the time to gather it is <hi>May,</hi> becauſe then it is much more impregnated with the Univerſal Spirit, and filled with that ſpiritual Salt, which adminiſters nouriſhment to all things, cauſeth their generation, and gives them maintenance.</p>

                           <p>YOU muſt not think ſtrange, if we reckon Honey among Meteors, ſince Dew contributes much to its generation; for it thickens after its falling upon Plants, detains and condenſes in it ſelf thoſe vapours, which Plants do continually exhale, aſſiſted by the cool of the Night; and the Suns heat doth digeſt and concoct all into Honey and Wax, which Bees do after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gather, and carry into their Hives, for their own ſuſtenance and nouriſhment. From this that we have ſaid, the conſequence may eaſily be drawn, why one ſeaſon of the year doth abound more with Honey then the other. The beſt Honey is that which is of a whitiſh yellow, pleaſant to the taſte and ſmell, neither too thin nor too thick, compacted in its parts, and eaſily melting upon the tongue. That which young Bees do yield, is better then old Bees Honey. From it is extracted a Water, an Oyl, a Spirit, Salt, and Tincture. From Wax alſo, which is an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſtick cleaving ſubſtance, is extracted the Phlegm, Spirit, Butter, Oyl, and a very ſmall proportion of Flowers, which are nothing elſe but the volatile Salt of this Compound.</p>

                              <head>The manner of Extracting the Principles of Honey.</head>
                              <p>TAke a quantity of Honey, and put it in a Glaſs Veſſel, white Earth, or Stone Bottle Earth, and put above it about
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170969:73"/>ii ℥ of Hemp, or Flax-Tow, to hinder the Honey from raiſing into the head by its ebullition; cover the Glaſs or Veſſel with its head or Limbeck, and lute or ſtop well the joynts with two bands or fillets of Paper, ſpread over with Pap made with flower and water boyled together; put your Cucurbite or Veſſel in ſand, and give a ſlow fire at firſt, to extract only the Water by this firſt degree of heat; then change your Receiver and increaſe the fire, which ſhall drive up a ſecond water, of a yellowiſh colour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Spirit; and increaſing yet one degree more, you ſhall have a red Spirit with its Oyl, which muſt be ſeparated by the Funnel, and the Spirit rectified. That which remains in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, calcine in a Reverberatory Furnace, to extract the Salt thereof with its own Phlegm, and then evaporate either to a total drought, or to a skin only, to get Cryſtals in a cool place.</p>
                              <p>Both theſe Waters of Honey, <hi>viz.</hi> the Clear and the Yellow, are very uſefull to cleanſe and clear the Eyes, take away films, ſpots, or blemiſhes; to cauſe Hair to grow: the Spirit is a great remover of Obſtructions; for, being taken from fifteen to twenty drops, in Aperitive Waters, or decoction of Nettle-roots and Burdock, it opens all Obſtructions, provokes Urine, and drives away Gravel, clammy and viſcous humours in the Reins and Bladder. The Oyl being circulated in Spirit of Wine twenty or thirty dayes, becomes very ſweet and pleaſant; it conduces won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully to the cure of Gun-ſhots, and to cleanſe corroding and cancerous Ulcers: It is a ſingular remedy to appeaſe the pain of the Gout; as alſo to take away the ſpots of the face, being mixt with a little Oyl of Camphire.</p>

This truth cannot be contradicted in the hiſtorical part; and curious ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Nature, may ſee whenever they liſt, that ſparks of light do iſſue forth out of living Creatures, if they take the pains to rub a Cat-skin in the dark, againſt the hair, a ſufficient proof to verifie more and more that light is not only the Principle of Compoſition in all things, but is alſo the Principle of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and the chief cheriſher of life.

                              <p>Take Hair either of male or female, as they are found in Barbers ſhops, or Periwick-makers, and fill therewith a Glaſs Retort, rather then an Earthen one, by reaſon of the ſubtilty of their Spirits, and put it in a Sand Furnace, (which for abbrevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we will call only Sand hereafter): To this, fit exactly a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and large Receiver, and lute the Joynts; the Lute being dry, begin firſt to give it a moderate fire; which increaſe by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, till the vapours begin to fill and abundantly the Recipient; and keep the Fire in this ſtate, until, the vapours being ſpent, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170969:77"/>begins to grow clear of it ſelf; then encreaſe the Fire more violently, that nothing of what may be driven out of the Retort do remain, and the Calcination of the remainder, may perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be performed; then ceaſing the fire, let the Veſſels cool, and you ſhall find in the Recipient two different ſubſtances, which are the Armoniac Spirit of the Hair, and the Oyl, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the ſulphurous portion of this Mixt, mingled with the groſſer part of the Volatile Salt. Theſe two Subſtances after ſeparation, may be applyed to Phyſical uſes: But it is nevertheleſs neceſſary, to rectifie them before hand, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit in <hi>B.

                              <p>The Spirit of Hair is not inwardly given, partly by reaſon of its ill taſte and odour, partly becauſe Art doth extract from other parts of Man, other Spirits more pleaſing, and leſs nauſeous in their uſe. This Spirit then is never uſed, but with a mixture of Honey, to anoint the parts where Hair are thin, and grow in ſmall quantity, or altogether fallen away: The Oyl is ſoverain to eradicate Tetters in what part ſoever of the Body they grow, making a Liniment of it with Salt of Saturn, and applying to the place, after a due Purgation given to the Patient fit for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling ſeroſities. The Aſhes mixt with Mutton-ſuet in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Sear-cloth, produce wonderful effects in the cure of ſtrains, and the ſtrengthning of diſ-joynted and diſlocated parts. Add to this, that Hair unwrought, are a very preſent remedy to ſtanch running of bloud, either in wounds, bleeding of the noſe, or immoderate courſes of women.</p>

                              <p>TO prepare any Remedy from the After-burthen, you muſt chuſe (if poſſible) one of the firſt birth, and a male: the Woman being of a middle age, as from 18 to 35 years, ſound, Black or Cheſ-nut hair; the Red-hair Women (as participating ſomething of Arſenical Spirits) are to be abſolutely excepted. And if the Artiſt cannot recover one of the firſt child, let him at leaſt have it of a male child: and, unleſs in abſolute neceſſity, make no uſe of a female, which only in ſuch caſe he is allowed to do: for being both male and female are nouriſhed in the ſame womb with the ſame menſtruous bloud, there is but the difference of the ſtrength and vigour, conſiderable in the choyce.</p>
                              <p>Take then ſuch an After-burthen (as is ſaid) with all the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions requiſite, put in a Glaſs Cucurbit, and diſtil in <hi>B.

But you are to note, that neither in diſtilling nor drying of it, it muſt not be turned upſide downwards, that the Spirit and Volatile Salt may the better concentrate themſelves, becauſe it is this Salt which properly gives vertue, to the Powder that is to be made thereof.</p>
                              <p>The Water thus extracted, is an excellent Coſmetick, ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonderfully the skin, both of hands and face, takes away the wrinckles, and ſpots; chiefly, if you add a little Salt of

And to prove in general, the divers Medicinal Vertues of Urine, we ſhall only hint, that the waſhing with it, when newly voided, doth dry and heal itches and ſcab, diſſolve tumors being applyed warm, mundifies and clenſeth wounds and venemous ulcers, prevents gangreen; opens gently the body without gripings, being adminiſted in Glyſters lukewarm; for, it it be ſuffered to cool, it loſes that Volatile Spirit wherein the chief Vertue of it doth conſiſt; hindereth, or at leaſt, leſſeneth the fits of certain Agues, if it be applyed warm to the wriſt, and in frontals: healeth the ulcerous Ears, being poured in; taketh away the redneſs and the itching of the Eyes,

                              <p>All what we have ſaid hitherto, is only to make it plain, how much more excellent and capable of producing its Effects, well prepared Urin, and ſeparated from its groſs impurity ſhall be, than when it is yet corporeal; and to prove more and more, that the chief, nay almoſt all the Vertues of mixt Bodies, do proceed from their Spirits, and Salts.</p>
                              <p>They that will make uſe of Urin in Pharmacy, or Chymical operations, muſt chuſe (if they can) that of wholeſom Bodies of young men, or children, from the age of 10. until 15. years, drinking Wine, if it may be had ſo, if not, ſuch as they can meet with; for all Urin is never without its Spirit and Salt: But in Urin of this latter ſort, they will be fewer and groſſer.

                              <p>The firſt preparation is common and ſimple: for it preſcribes only to cut it and boyl it in White-wine, untill the pieces are well criſped, and the moyſture of the Wine evaporated; then cruſh it between two Tin-plates warmed before: and ſo keep it for uſe.</p>
                              <p>The ſecond preparation is, when you intend an Anodine Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cooling, and reſolving, which may very ſucceſſefully be applyed in ſwellings, inflamations, hardneſſes, and other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents uſually happening to Wounds and Ulcers, either by the Patients own diſtemper and ill diet, or the Chirurgeons neglect and unskilfulneſs: You muſt thus prepare it. Take Phlegm of Vitriol, or Allum, impregnated with their ſharp, ſowre ſpirit, about <abbr>lb</abbr> ſs. put therein to digeſt in Sand ℥ ii. of waſhed and dryed Litharge or white Lead, ſtirring it often; and when your Liquor is well impregnated, filtrate it, and thereof make a Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the form of a <hi>Nutritum:</hi> and if you deſire to make it more ſpecifick, add to it in the ſtirring ſome proportion of the Tincture of Myrrhe and Aloes, drawn with good Spirit of Wine.</p>
                              <p>The third and laſt preparation is the exacteſt and beſt, and is performed by diſtillation in this manner. Take 1 p. of Fat, and 2 or 3 p. of decrepitated Salt, and being well mixed and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated together, put it in a glaſs Retort, joyned to its Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, both well luted <hi>S. A.</hi> in a Sand-furnace, then give it a graduate fire, untill the bottom of the Retort groweth red, which may be performed in the ſpace of eight hours; and thus ſhall you have an Oyl of a ſubtile and penetrative nature, a ſoveraign remedy to re-animate, and take away the benumming of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytick
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170969:84"/>Limbs, which for the moſt part are cooled and deprived of nouriſhment: better by much then the ſubſtance from whence it was extracted, to all the uſes and purpoſes which we have aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it hereabove. And if you will make this Oyl yet more ſubtle and penetrating, circulate it in <hi>Balneo</hi> with equal p. of Sp. of Wine, for the ſpace of ſome dayes; then rectifie and diſtill in Aſhes, in a low Glaſs body; by this means it ſhall become ſo penetrating, that ſcarce it can be preſerved in Glaſs, and becomes imperceptible as ſoon as applyed, by reaſon of its quick pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration.</p>
                              <p>Theſe Preparations already deſcribed, may be a pattern for all other kinds of Oyls, Butters, Fats, and ſuch like, which by this method may be made more efficacious and penetrating.</p>

                              <p>Take the Bones of a Man extingniſhed by violent death, which neither have been buryed under ground, nor boyled, nor put in Quick-lime, and ſaw them in pieces of a convenient ſize to be put in a Retort well luted, and being filled not above the two third part: put it in a cloſe Reverberatory Furnace with open fire; and having exactly luted and fitted a Recipient to it, cover the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberatory, leaving only a hole of about the bigneſs of an inch and a half diameter, to be as a Regiſter for ruling the fire, which ought to be moderately graduated, untill all the white ſteams be over; then change your Recipient, or empty the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the firſt, and lute it again exactly, continuing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the fire, untill you drive out the Oyl with a Volatile Salt and the remainder of the Spirit, which work muſt be thus purſued, untill the Recipient begins to clear of it ſelf, which will happen in the ſpace of twelve hours, from the beginning of your Operation. But you muſt note, that the duſt coming out of the ſawing of the Bones, muſt be preſerved, or ſome other provided by ſcraping or filing, to be uſed in rectifying of the Spirit, Oyl, or Volatile Salt. You muſt alſo calcine and reverberate with open
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170969:84"/>fire to whiteneſs, between bricks, the pieces or lump remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your Retort, that they may ſerve in a manner to ſtay and fix the Volatile Salt, which otherwiſe, by reaſon of its ſubtile nature, cannot be preſerved: as we ſhall declare, when we come to ſpeak of the diſtillation and rectification of the Extract of Harts-horn.</p>
                              <p>I cannot here bury under ſilence an experiment wherein I was an Eye-witneſs, in the perſon of a Cornet, who had received a Musket-ſhot in the thigh, neer unto the knee, and who after the wound healed, had both his leg and knee ſo ſtrangely put out of their natural poſture and ſituation, that his heel did almoſt ſtick unto the buttock, which made him uncapable of the function of his employment. But their Surgeon major, who was a <hi>High Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> did undertake the reſtoring of his knee to its natural motion; which to effect, he adminiſtred unto him every day, for the ſpace of ſix weeks, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. of the powder of a thigh or leg-bone of a man, who ſome yeers before had been diſſected, in his ordinary Broths; by which he did recover not only the bending of his knee, but made him capable, before the ſix weeks ended, to Fence, play at Tennis, ride on Horſe back, and perform all other exerciſes. Whence you may note, that ſo rare a Cure could not proceed but from the volatile, ſpiritual and penetrating Salt, which this reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy did contain, ſince the material part of the bone could never paſs ſo far as the laſt digeſtions. I have quoted this hiſtory, to no other purpoſe then to perſwade the better, and lay more open to the underſtanding, the effects of thoſe remedies which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the skull and bones of Man, by diſtillation, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating artificially the pure parts from impurity. The Spirit and Volatile Salt of Mans skull is given againſt Epilepſie, in water of Lime-tree flowers, Lilly-Convally, or Piony: that of bones is alſo ſucceſſefully adminiſtred, to reſtore contracted and dryed Limbs; provided you rub them alſo with Balſom of Modern Mummy: The Oyl of skull and bones is only applyable out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, to cleanſe and heal filthy and corroding Ulcers, provided you mix a little powder of Colchotar, and every other day plye the patient with vulnerary and purgative potions. The Doſis of the Spirit is from three drops to ten, and of the Volatile Salt fixed from four grains to eight.</p>

But when the Spring, repairer of Nature, reſtores again the freſh Graſs to Valleys, and tender buds to the Copſes, they are ſo plentifully re-animated with a new fire, that the ſublimated Spirits ſhooting into the head, do provoke them by a violent itching to caſt their old head, which at that time is become ſpongious and hollow, and ſpoiled of its beſt and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part, which is a volatile ſpiritual Salt, in which doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt all its Medicinal vertue; after which they recover a new Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet head, ſoft in the beginning, and filled with a very ſubtile Salt; which hardens by degrees, till it hath attained to its full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: From whence we may gather, that it is very neceſſary to have a regard in the choyce of the heads of this noble Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for, you muſt not take for Operations, any of the caſt

                              <p>MAny are of opinion that Harts-horn cannot be made tender and crumbling enough to be eaſily afterwards reduced to powder, without previous Calcination; but as this way of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination deprives it from its Spirits and Salt, the Sons of Art have found a way of a Philoſophical Calcination, which preſerves its vertue: whereby may eaſily appear how much ancient Pharmacy doth come ſhort from that which in our dayes hath received the light of Chymiſtry.</p>
                              <p>Take then well-choſen Harts-horn, and gathered in its true ſeaſon; ſaw it in pieces of the length of a Pan about the ends, then putting two ſticks croſſe-wayes towards the top of ſuch a Glaſs Body as uſually ſerves for diſtillation of Spirits and Waters, there ſuſpend with a pack-thred pieces of the branches of the Deers head cut as before, when you are to diſtill any Cordial Waters, ſuch as of <hi>Carduus Benedictus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lmaria,</hi> or ſmall Centaury; or, which would yet be better, when you goe about to diſtill any fermented matters, which ſend forth more penetrative and ſubtile vapours, you muſt cover the glaſs body with a Limbeck, and give
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170969:86"/>the ſame degree of fire as for the diſtilling of <hi>Aqua Vitae;</hi> ſo ſhall theſe vapours penetrate into the very center of your Harts-horn, and make it as eaſie to crumble and be reduced to powder, as if calcined with open fire, and grinded upon the Porphyry: but you muſt proſecute the work of your diſtillation, four or five dayes, without intermiſſion or opening the Veſſel; for which reaſon, the Glaſs Body muſt have a hole towards the upper part, placed ſide-wiſe, whereby to recruit it with warm Water pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably as it diminiſhes by diſtillation, taking care alſo that the Liquor ſhould not come neer the ſuſpended matter by half a foot. And if it be objected, that the vapours may carry along with them the moſt ſubtile Spirits of the Harts-horn: We anſwer, that it may be ſo, and that theſe cordial and ſudorifick Waters, whether diſtilled Spirits of fermented Juniper, or Elder-berries, do thereby contract a greater vertue: but that this vaporous heat is not ſufficient to carry along with it the Volatile Salt, incloſed up in the matter by the ſtrict bond and union it hath with the Oyl or Sulphur, which cannot be diſunited but by a much more violent heat. Harts-horn thus prepared, is much better then that which did remain in the foregoing diſtillation, as much to ſtrengthen and provoke ſweat, as to give to Children againſt Worms, and hinders all thoſe corruptions which breed for the moſt part in their tender ſtomacks. The Doſis is from ℈ ſs. to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ſs;. and ℈ ii. in cordial and ſudorifick Waters, or in ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Conſerve, againſt all Peſtilential and Venemous Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>

                              <head>How to prepare the Spirit, Oyl, and Volatile Salt of Harts-horn.</head>
                              <p>TAke of Harts-horn with its requiſite conditions, as much as you think fit, ſaw it by round pieces of the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of two Crowns, fill with it a Glaſs Cucurbit or Retort well Luted, and put it in a cloſe Reverberatory to open fire, which graduate untill the drops begin to follow one another in the Recipient well Luted with a wet Bladder, and fall no faſter then you may reckon Four between the interval of each drop falling; then continue and direct the fire upon the ſame equality and rule, untill the drops begin to ceaſe; then remove your
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170969:87"/>Receiver, and empty it, then put it again, and lute it with good ſalted Lute <hi>S. A.</hi> and encreaſe the fire by a degree, untill the Oyl doth begin to diſtill, with ſome little remainder of the Spirit, and the Volatile Salt will gather it ſelf by degrees, and ſtick to the neck of the Retort, and thence paſs in the form of a Vapour in the body of the Recipient, where it ſhall ſtick to the ſide in the figure and form of Stags-horns, and branches of Trees, when they are loaden with hoar-froſt or ſnow; which is an Operation very pleaſing to the ſight; for, of this Volatile Salt ſome part alſo under the ſhape of ſnow, doth fall into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Recipient, and joyns it ſelf to the Spirit which is under the Oyl. Then continue the laſt degree of fire, untill nothing more cometh out, and the Recipient begins to appear without vapours.</p>
                              <p>But it is not enough to have extracted out of Harts-horn theſe ſeveral Subſtances, but the Artiſt muſt be taught beſides how to rectifie them, both to take away as much as is poſſible the <hi>Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuma</hi> thereof, as to ſeparate its groſſeneſs; And to begin with the firſt extracted Subſtance, which is the Spirit, it muſt be rectified in Aſhes, with gentle and ſoft fire, in a Glaſs Retort, wherein you have put ſawings or ſcrapings of Harts-horn three or four fingers high, and ſo ſhall the Spirit come forth fair, clear, depurated and deprived of the greateſt part of its ill odour: The firſt drawn is to be preferred to the laſt; becauſe it is a Volatile Spirit, whoſe nature it is to aſcend firſt ſtill; the remainder muſt be caſt away, as unuſefull and unſerviceable, but the rectified Spirit is to be choyſely kept in a Glaſs Viol of a narrow neck, very well ſtopt.</p>
                              <p>It is an excellent remedy either inwardly or outwardly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for it purifies and cleanſes the whole maſs of the Blood, of its ſerous ſuperfluities by Urines and by Sweat, as alſo by inſenſible Tranſpiration; therefore it is a true Specifick againſt Scurvey, the Pox, and all other Diſeaſes proceeding from alteration of blood. Finally, this Volatile Spirit may worthily be ſubſtituted to that which is or may be extracted from all the parts of other Animals, and to be an excellent remedy to all the ſame purpoſes as the others formerly mentioned. But outwardly applyed, it is alſo of a marvailous uſe; for it cleanſes wonderfully all malignant,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170969:87"/>corroſive, cancerous, or fiſtulous Ulcers, if they be waſhed with it, or if it be injected with a Springe. It ſerves alſo for freſh wounds, cauſed either by fire, ſword, or otherwiſe, preventing all dangerous accidents; it is friendly to Nature, and helps her to the re-union of ſeparated parts, whoſe intention being not to cauſe ſuppuration, or a colliquation of the fleſh and adjacent parts, ſo doth this Spirit hinder the ſame: But note alſo, that you muſt give it inwardly at the ſame time, from ſix drops to twelve, in vulnerary potions, or the Patients ordinary drink. To be ſhort, this Spirit is nothing elſe but a Volatile Salt turned to Liquor, as the Volatile Salt reciprocally a Spirit compacted and condenſated; whence it comes to paſs, that they may indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently be adminiſtred to the ſame purpoſe, except that the Doſis of the Volatile Salt, muſt be ſomething leſs then that of the Spirit; ſo that the vertues attributed to the one, may be ſaid alſo to be proper to the other.</p>
                              <p>We have no other obſervation to impart, for the rectifying of the Volatile Salt and Oyl, but that the Operation muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a Retort, upon ſcrapings of Harts-horn, and with the fame circumſtances for regulating the fire. So ſhall you have a fair, clear, and Ruby-red Oyl, ſwimming over the Volatile Salt paſſed into the Recipient, or ſublimated to the neck of the Glaſs, the Salt muſt be diſſolved with its proper rectified Spirit, by a diſſolution made in the vaporous heat of lukewarm water, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate it from the Oyl: This diſſolution is to be filtrated through Paper, which muſt be moyſtened by the Spirit before you pour any thing into it, and you ſhall have the Oyl by it ſelf, and the Salt in its proper Spirit, which thereby is ſo much bettered, and keeps thus better then alone, unleſs it be ſtayed and fixed, as we ſhall direct to do hereafter. To this end put the diſſolution of the Salt and Spirit in a Cucurbit in <hi>Balneo</hi> to diſtill again the Spirit, and ſublimate the Salt in the head, or if you pleaſe in a Retort: It is almoſt impoſſible to preſerve this Salt, ſo penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ſubtile it is, therefore it muſt be ſtayed in the following manner. Take the round pieces which were left in the bottom, after the diſtillation performed, being very black, calcine them in open fire to whiteneſs, reduce one part to powder, which mix with equal weight of its Volatile Salt, and ſublime together,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170969:88"/>and ſo begin afreſh with new Harts-horn calcined to whiteneſs re-iterating four or five times, and thus ſhall you have a volatile Salt fixed, which you may keep, tranſport or ſend with leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the Spirit: nevertheleſs, it is my counſel to uſe rather Spirit, filled, and as it were ſaturated with volatile Salt, to all the ends and purpoſes to be declared hereafter.</p>
                              <p>This Remedy might truly be called a <hi>Panacea,</hi> or <hi>
                                    <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,</hi> conſidering the wonderful effects it is apt to produce; for it is ſoverain againſt Epilepſie, Apoplexy, Lethargy, &amp; generally againſt all Diſeaſes, whoſe ſpring and original is aſcribed unto the Brain: It takes away all obſtructions of Liver, Spleen, Meſentery, and Pancreas; reſiſts all Venoms, Peſtilence, and all kinds of Fevers, or aguiſh diſtempers, none excepted. It clenſes the Kidneys and Bladder from all ſlimy ſubſtances, which are the cauſe and original of Stones; corrects all defects of the Ventricle, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly indigeſtions, which occaſions an ill breath: it is a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical remedy for the Lungs, if it be digeſted with the Milk of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur. It allayes the immoderate looſneſs of the Belly, and the womans purgations, becauſe it evacuates ſuperfluous ſeroſities, which are the cauſe thereof: but, that which ſeemeth more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable and wonderful, is, that it opens alſo the Belly when bound, and provokes Monthly Purgations, reſtoring all the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Nature in their former eſtate, and removes all groſs and terreſtrious matters, which did hinder their effect. I make no doubt, but I ſhall appear ridiculous to all them which do not underſtand the ſphere of activity of Volatile Salts: but I know likewiſe, that thoſe who know with me, that this Salt is the laſt cover, and cloak as it were, of Spirit and Light, ſhall not find it ſtrange, that I ſhould attribute ſo many noble effects, to this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Remedy. But I will yet unfold and open more this Myſtery, as much as lies in me, by a deſcription of what dayly is done in our Kitchings, in the preparation of meats, both for healthy and ſick people. Is it not unknown to all, that no Cook can make either a Bisk or good Bagon, without making uſe of the Broth, gravy, and juyces of the beſt kinds of meat; now it is only by their Volatile Salt, variouſly diſpoſed and mixt, that the pleaſure and tickling which affects our taſte, is communicated to the Palate. Are there not alſo Jelleys, ſtrong Broths, and Juyces
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170969:88"/>of boyled Meats prepared for the ſick, whereof the material and earthly dregs and ſuperfluities are thrown away, being deprived of that Salt, which remains in the Jelleys; and is the only prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of congelation: they are exhibited to weak and craſie bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that their Stomack might ſooner turn theſe aliments to the ſubſtance of the parts by the eaſineſs of digeſtion. The ſame doth our Artiſt in the preparation of the Volatile Salts, which are capable to ſhow ſuddenly their Vertues, in that they ſoon penetrate all the parts of our bodies, and carry along with them that wonderful efficacy which we have attributed them. And do we not ſee, that both the ancient and modern Phyſick, hath ever preſcribed Harts-horn as a neceſſary ingredient amongſt her Cordials, hath in very great eſteem the bone of a Stags-heart, and that the ſhops dayly prepare Harts-horn Jelley, rather to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Patient, then to nouriſh him. But we leave all this to the Touch-ſtone of Experience, which is the true ground of all our fore-going Ratiocinations.</p>

                              <p>TAke the Volatile Salt rectified, and put it in a double Glaſs, or Blind-head, which would yet be better in a Pelican; pour on twice the weight of it of Alkool of Wine, and ſo let it ſtand twelve or fifteen days, in extraction and digeſtion together, in the gentle heat of a vaporous Bath; and if all the Salt was not diſſolved, draw off what is already tincted by inclination, and pour on new Alkool to perfect the extraction and diſſolution.

                              <p>The ſame may be done with the Volatile Salt ſtayed, and as it were fixed, but it will not all diſſolve, neither ſhall its tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture be of that penetration and efficacy; but it will be much more pleaſing, and deprived of the nauſeous ſmell: The <hi>doſis</hi> of the firſt is from iij. drops to viij. or ix; and of the ſecond from vi. drops to xij.</p>

                              <head>Of the Preparations made out of Vipers.</head>
                              <p>WE ſhall cloſe this Chapter of the Chymical Preparations of Animals, by examining the ſeveral Remedies which Vipers do afford by the help of Chymiſtry: for this Reptile is endowed with a very ſubtile and efficacious Volatile Salt for the cure of ſeveral obſtinate diſeaſes. <hi>Galen</hi> doth make ſeveral relations of leprous bodies cured by the only drinking of Wine wherein Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers had been ſuffocated. <hi>Cardan</hi> doth alſo prove the ſame truth, in a conſultation which he ſent to <hi>John Archbiſhop</hi> of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> containing this ſenſe. I will declare you a very great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret for the cure of conſumptive bodies, leprous, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded with Pox, &amp;c. which fattens and reſtores them againſt all hope. Take a well choſen Viper, cut off the head and tayl, pull off the skin, throw away the entrails, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Fat by it ſelf: cut it in bits as you would do an Eel, and ſod it in a ſufficient quantity of Water, with Benjeethin and Salt, adding towards the end ſome few Parſley leafs: being well ſodden, ſtrain the Broth, and in that Broth boyl a Pullet, and give every morning to the Patient Bread that hath been dipt in that Broth, and let him eat the Pullet: Continue thus ſeven dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but keep the Patient either in a Stove, or a very warm Room during the time, and anoint him with the Vipers fat all along the back-bone and other joynts of the body, as alſo the arteries of the feet, hands, and breſt. This way are the Ulcers of the Lungs cured, for they are driven to the ſurface of the skin in the form of Puſtula's and other eruptions. <hi>Quercetan</hi> doth alſo ſpeak very advantagiouſly of Vipers in his Dogmatical Pharmacy. Several other Authors have followed theſe two: but we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge here, that they have all ſtumbled againſt the ſame rock, holding the Viper to be venemous either wholly in it ſelf, or at leaſt in ſome parts.</p>
                              <p>But the Experiment related by <hi>Galen,</hi> muſt confound this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ancient and Modern Authors, ſince that Viper was whole and alive, when ſuffocated in the Wine which did cure his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouſy. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies herein ſhame the vulgar of Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans themſelves, making no ſcruple to drink of that Wine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170969:89"/>living and intire Vipers have been ſuffocated, to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their plumpneſs. Sound diſpoſition of Body, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirits, hinder the injury of wrinckles, and preſerve their flying beauty. But that which is yet more remarkable in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, is, that the <hi>Italian Curteſana's</hi> preſeve themſelves againſt the Venerian diſeaſe, and its ſad accidents, taking every Spring and fall, Broths, made of Pullets, Vipers fleſh, and China root. None amongſt our Modern Phyſitians, but the famous <hi>Poterius,</hi> and the moſt learned and ſubtil Philoſopher <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> have well explained wherein the poyſon of Vipers doth conſiſt; which is only placed in the ſting of choler, which prints in the imagination of that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal an envenomed Idea.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Fabritius Hildanus,</hi> and many other grave and renowned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, do by their obſervations authoriſe the truth of the effects; but the two quoted only have taught us the true ſeat of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which cannot be but in the Spirit of the Animals life; as the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb hints very well; which faith, that <hi>Morta la Beſtia, morto il veleno,</hi> ſince Man it ſelf, Dogs, Horſes, Wolfs, Cats, Pole-cats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> leave no venemous impreſſion by their bitings, but when they are angered, and their Imagination poyſoned with a deſire of rage and vengeance.</p>
                              <p>And let this hint ſuffice by the by, to prove more and more, that all the Vertue of things is placed in the Spirits and Life, which are nothing elſe but a portion of the Univerſal Spirit, and corporified light. We come now to the Preparations made of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and of their parts.</p>

                              <head>The manner of deſiccating Vipers, to make the Powder and Trochisks thereof.</head>
                              <p>THe election of Vipers doth only conſiſt in taking them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have forſaken their holes, and are more full and fed; the regard of their ſex is indifferent, provided the female is not big with young ones: they are to be choſen in high elevated and dry places, leaving them that breed about Ponds, or Moriſh and watery places.</p>
                              <p>Take of theſe Vipers as much as you pleaſe, pull off the skin and the entrails, keeping the Heart and Liver; then put them in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170969:90"/>a large Glaſs Body or Cucurbit, where you may have ſufficient room to place and order them upon ſmall ſticks, that they may not touch one the other: place your Glaſs with a Head in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and ſo deſiccate your Vipers; having firſt ſtrewed over a little Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre very pure, or Flowers of Salt Armoniack; preſerve the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which ſhall iſſue forth from it, for ſuch uſes as we ſhall hint hereafter. <hi>Nota,</hi> that every 12. hours your Vipers muſt be turned in the Glaſs, that they may dry equally.</p>
                              <p>Thus ſhall you have a matter to make the true Powder of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, not full of thrids or filaments, which may be adminiſtred in its own Water, or in Wine, or Cinamon, or Saſſafras Water from ℈ i. to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. in all Fevers, but particularly in peſtilential and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious ones, and in the Plague it ſelf, as alſo againſt Epilepſie and Apoplexy: but the other following Preparations are preferrable to this Powder.</p>
                              <p>But if you will prepare Trochisks, take other Vipers, and pulling off their skins and entrails, cut them in pieces, and boyl them in the water, which you did preſerve in the preceding diſtillation, in a hot boyling <hi>Balneo,</hi> in a Glaſs Body covered with its Head, until this Broth comes to be of the conſiſtency of a Jelley: with this Jelley beat in a Marble Mortar the Vipers Powder, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to Paſte, which you ſhall frame in Trochisks or ſmall rolls, having anointed your hands with Peruvian Balſom, Oyl of Cloves and Nutmegs made by expreſſion: Thoſe that will rightly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Triacle, may make uſe of theſe Trochisks inſtead of them which the ancient Diſpenſatories do preſcribe, which are only crumbs of Bread, and Vipers Fleſh deſtituted of all the faculties, which reſide in their Volatile Salt. The Powder of theſe Trochisks is preferrable to the ſingle Powder, becauſe they are impregnated with the proper ſubſtance and vertue of the Animal, beſides that they are leſs apt to corrupt then the Powder. The <hi>doſis</hi> is from ℈ ſs to ℈ ij. in the Waters above-mentioned.</p>

                              <head>How the Spirit, Oyl, volatile Salt, volatile fixed Salt, ſublimation of that Salt, and the fixed Salt of Vipers, is to be prepared.</head>
                              <p>I Should be unjuſt to attribute unto my ſelf the manner and invention of all theſe Operations, ſince the glory is lawfully due to the learned <hi>Zwelpherus,</hi> Phyſitian to his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, yet living, who by his accurate learned and judicious Notes, upon the <hi>Auſpurgian Pharmacy,</hi> hath purchaſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an Immortal name; having corrected the defects of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> with ſo clear a judgement and ſo uncontrollable and confirmed an experience, that all thoſe which will follow the operations of the nobleſt <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> muſt ever acknowledge themſelves his debtors.</p>
                              <p>I will only hint, in the way, that the invention of Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliſing again the volatile Salt of Vipers is mine, after it hath been as it were fixed by an acid ſubſtance. And as this gallant man hath been pleaſed to make his Experiments become publick, thereby to oblige Poſterity; ſo would I not conceal the ſecret of this operation, ſince thereby a great benefit may accrew to poor diſeaſed bodies, although the invention of it be not vulgar, and does particularly belong to my diſcovery.</p>
                              <p>Take well fed Vipers without diſtinction of ſex, pull out the Entrails, and ſeparate the Heart and Liver, dry them in a Stove or Oven, moderately heated, and being thus very well dryed, beat into groſs Powder, and fill therewith a Glaſs Retort, which put in a cloſe Reverberatory, upon the cover of an Earthen Pot turned up-ſide down, upon which put two handful of Aſhes or Sand, to fence the Retort inſtead of lute, and hinder the firſt brunt and violence of fire; then cover your Reverberatory, and fit a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Receiver to the Neck of the Retort, and give a graduate fire, until the Retort grows red, and the Recipient cleareth during the violence of the fire, which is an evident token that all the vapours are diſperſt, that is done in leſs then 12 hours. When all is cooled again, you ſhall find three different Subſtances in your Receiver, which are the Phlegm and Spirit mixt together; the Oyl black and ſtinking, and the volatile Salt ſticking to the ſides of it. The volatile Salt which is about the ſides, muſt be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170969:91"/>diſſolved with the ſpirituous Liquor in the bottom, then muſt this Liquor be ſeparated from its Oyl by filtration, put afterwards the Liquor impregnated with Volatile Salt, in a high Cucurbit or Glaſs Body covered with its Head, and exactly luted in the Joynts, and adapt to it a ſmall <hi>matraſſe</hi> for Recipient, then put your Glaſs in a Sand or Aſh Furnace, and regulate well the fire, leſt the bitter and ſtinking Water, which hath diſſolved the volatile Salt aſcend within: the ſublimation being ended, ſeparate the Salt curiouſly, and preſerve it in a Viol ſtopt with Cork dipt in melted Wax, upon which pour a little of melted Brimſtone, if you will preſerve this Salt, otherwiſe it will vaniſh in a ſhort time, by reaſon of the ſubtile and penetrating nature of its vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>erial ſubſtance. It is this volatile Salt that poſſeſſeth ſo many rare vertues and wonderful effects; for it hinders all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which uſe to breed in us, opens all obſtructions of the humane body, diſſolves and carries away all aguiſh diſtempers, and particularly the Quartane, being exhibited from 6. to 10 grains in Saſſafras, Juniper, or Elder Water, one or two hours before the Fit: it is moreover given in the Plague, and all other conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Diſeaſes, in Emulſions made of Columbine, Radiſh, <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus Benedictus</hi> ſeed, to which are joyned Amands, Kernels of Pine-Aples, Sugar, and a little Roſe or Cinamon Water. It is alſo ſingular againſt Epilepſie and Apoplexy: for it ſearches into the deepeſt parts of the bones and marrows; it is to be exhibited in Emulſions made of Water of Lilly Convally, Piony Flowers, Lime-tree, Piony-ſeeds, Almonds, Kernels of Cherries, Peaches or Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>But becauſe this Salt is of a very unpleaſant ſmell, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury taſte, Artiſts have been long about ſeeking the means how to deſpoil it of theſe two qualities, as alſo the Salt of Urine. yellow Amber, Harts-horn, and of the parts of man: but hitherto, none hath attained to this skill and perfection, without depriving theſe volatile Salts of their ſubtility, and by conſequence, their penetrating and diaphoretick vertue. The learned and experienced <hi>Zwelferus</hi> alone, hath well attained the Art of this uſeful and curious operation, after he had tryed firſt without ſucceſs ſeveral other different wayes. But the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> of this Salt given in a larger proportion, ſhows enough,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170969:91"/>that this purification doth fix it in a manner; and that although it be fixed, and more pleaſant to the taſt, it is notwithſtanding of leſs efficacy.

                           <p>IN this Chapter we intend to make it manifeſt, that the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and perſecutors of this noble Art, are very much to be blamed, when they diſcovered it; and that their upbraidings done to the Artiſts and Practitioners of it, are falſe and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, ſince the Preparations which we are to deſcribe, are capable to bring the moſt envious to a ſober mind, and convince the moſt obſtinate, that the Pharmacy of the Ancients had never any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration coming nere its excellency. It is upon the ſeveral parts of this noble, pleaſant, and ample Family of Vegetables, that the true Pharmaceutick ſhall ever find matter of imployment, and admiration of the Creators works. But, as the deſign of our abridgement, doth not permit us to make the examination and reſolution of all Vegetables and their parts; we ſhall content our ſelves to give one or two examples, of the manner of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either upon the whole Vegetable, or the parts thereof, which are Roots, Leaves, Flowers, Fruits, Seeds, Rinds, Woods, Grains, or Berryes, Juyces, Oyls, Drops, Roſins, Gums. We ſhall give a Section to each of theſe parts, the better to explain the manner of working, and to avoid confuſion.</p>

                           <p>But before we come to the matter, I have thought neceſſary to ſay ſomething of the abuſes dayly committed by Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries not fully enlightned with the knowledge of Chymiſtry, and which are only guided by blind men, admiring and ſuffering all the defects of their ill preparation, want of a true information of the nature of things, and a right apprehenſion of Phyſical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the true gate to Medical skill. Whence it is leſs to be admired, that blind men guided by other blind, fall themſelves, and dayly cauſe ſo many other to fall with them in the pit. And as <hi>Germany</hi> hath <hi>Swelferus</hi> Phyſitian to his Imperial Majeſty, who hath reformed Pharmacy, in thoſe learned and accurate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations he hath made upon the <hi>Auſpurgian</hi> Diſpenſatory; ſo have we in <hi>France, Monſieur Vallot</hi> firſt Phyſitian to our Monarch, who hath laboured, and labours yet dayly, to cultivate the field of Phyſick, and vulgar Pharmacy, and to purge it from thoſe thorns and thiſtles, which the ignorance of Chymiſtry hath cauſed to grow, and too much over-ſpread the ſame.</p>
                           <p>This truth will I illuſtrate by the example of diſtilled Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that of Syrups, becauſe I know, that in theſe two Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, vulgar Apothecaries commit the greateſt faults for the moſt part, either through ignorance, malice, or covetuouſneſs, to the great diſhonour of Phyſick and Phyſitians, the diſcredit of their Profeſſion, and that which is yet worſe, the great damage of the common good.</p>

                              <p>IF Subſtances are not throughly known, it is impoſſible to have any good ſucceſs in their Preparation, ſince from this knowledge doth abſolutely depend, the exact and moſt commendable way of Operation: and, if that be neceſſary in all Chymical operations, much more is it in thoſe which concern Vegetables, and chiefly the manner of their diſtillation without waſting any of their vertue, which hath induced me to believe it neceſſary, to give a general Idea of the nature of Plants, before I come to ſpeak of their particular prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                              <pb n="163" facs="tcp:170969:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                              <p>We ſhall not ſpeak here of Plants according to the ſenſe of many; following the trace and ſteps of <hi>Botannick</hi> Authors, which for the moſt part have left us nothing but the external Picture of the Plant, and the divers degrees of their qualities, without taking any pains to teach us the differences of the intrinſecal nature of the ſame Plants, and much leſs the true manner of Anatomizing them, to ſeparate and extract from them all what is good and ſerviceable, and alſo what is unprofitable.</p>
                              <p>To begin methodically; we muſt explain the nature of Plants, as they are in themſelves, by the diviſion we make of them, according to the degrees of their increaſe and perpetuation: for, they are either long-lived, or annual: The Long-lived (or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacious) are thoſe whoſe roots in the two Aequinoxes do attract the univerſal nutriment to themſelves; in the Vernal Aequinox they attract what is neceſſary to bud out and vegetate, to the full perfection of the Plant, which ends by her flower and ſeed; and in the Autumnal Aequinox, they attract wherewithall to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the exhauſting of their ſtrength, cauſed by the Suns heat, and of the other Stars and Planets. This Note is not made by us without neceſſity, being abſolutely uſefull, to acquaint the Artiſt with the moſt proper and fitting time to gather the Plant with its root, or to leave the ſame as unneceſſary; for, if he hath need of the Plant a little after it is ſprung out of the Earth, he muſt meditate with himſelf, and make a judicious reflexion, that this Plant is not yet furniſhed with that ſaline and ſpirituous nutriment, the Principle whereof is contained in the root, and that ſo his Operation will be loſt upon this Plant; ſince what he may extract of it, is deſtituted of that ſtrength and vertue which is deſired by the Phyſician, and much more of that which is requiſite to ſhew its efficacy againſt the diſeaſe; his recourſe then ſhall be to the root, which containeth the Volatile Salt, the very ſoul of the Plant, and poſſeſſing in it ſelf the vertue and efficacy of the whole. But if he deſires to work upon the ſame Plant, when it hath almoſt attained to the period of her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and that it hath but yet a ſmall portion of its vertue left, which does adminiſter yet a kinde of languiſhing life, untill it hath recovered its vertue, ſtrength and new life, in the time of the Autumnal Aequinox, to the end that in Winter it may evade
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170969:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>deſtruction, and be renewed or born again in the Spring. By which it appears, that when the Plant is in her full ſtate, as they ſpeak commonly, the Artiſt muſt chooſe it between flower and ſeed, if he is deſirous to enjoy the full vertue thereof; for when it hath attained to that perfection, the ſtalk, leaf, flowers, and the firſt ſeeds, are yet full of vigour and vertue, which they communicate to the Liquor extracted by diſtillation, which being a Volatile and Mercurial Salt, and an Embryonated Sulphur, containeth all the vertue of the Plant; for, that which is extracted from it, is a ſpirituous Water, which preſerves it ſelf very long, with the proper taſte and odour of its ſubject, upon the ſurface of which ſwims an aethereal and ſubtile Oyl, which is that Embryonated Sulphur, mixt with part of its own Mercury. But if the Artiſt doth expect that the Plant ſhould ſhoot and concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate all its life in the ſeed, and that this Sulphur which was but embryonated, ſhould become actuated and fully ripe, he muſt then in ſuch a caſe reject the root, ſtalk, and leaf, becauſe they have no more in themſelves, that vertue which they had before. Here the Artiſt muſt meditate anew, and conſult with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Natures action; for, the ſeed being once perfected, hath no more that Mercurial and ſaline moyſture, which cauſed her vertue more eaſily to be extracted, but all is to the contrary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united, as it were, and lockt up under the skin of the kernel and the ſeed; and moreover, theſe ſeeds are of three differing kinds; for ſome are muſcilagineous, and ſlimy, or like unto a Jelly; in the firſt of theſe, the Mercurial Salt and Sulphur are more fixt then Volatile, and ſo theſe ſeeds will not yield their vertue, but by the means of decoction; for, as they are clammy and ſticking, the vertue thereof doth not aſcend in the diſtillation: The other are milky, of a white and tender ſubſtance, whence Oyl may be extracted by expreſſion, if ſo be they are well ripened and dryed; but their beſt vertue is only to be extracted, when you draw the Lacteous ſubſtance, or emulſion, out of it: For, this ſecond kinde of ſeed is equally mixt with Volatile Salt and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, which eaſily communicates it ſelf to Water; the Artiſt muſt not hope, by diſtillation to extract the vertue of this kinde of Seeds, no more then of the former. But there is a third kind of ſeed, altogether oleaginous and ſulphurous, which communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170969:95"/>to the Water neither any Mucilage, viſcoſity or clammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, no more then whiteneſs; but to the contrary, their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is compacted, drye, and aſtringent by a Sulphur predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant over the Salt. The Artiſt muſt diſtill this kind of ſeeds, either alone, or with addition; alone, if externally to be uſed; with addition, if it be to adminiſter the remedy, which he pretends to extract internally to the Patient. Theſe three differences or diſtinctions of ſeeds, do ſufficiently ſhew, that it is required for a Chymical Apothecary to be very well vers'd in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Nature, thereby to make the neceſſary obſervations upon the fixt and volatile parts of ſubſtances, whereupon he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, that his work may orderly proceed, and not be unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily confounded.</p>
                              <p>The ſame Notes and Theorems are to be applyed to annual Plants, which are not preſerved by their root, but are every year to be renewed by their ſeed. Now of theſe two ſorts of Plants, either vivacious or annual, as well as of Seeds, there are three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe that yield no ſmell, of which ſome are almoſt inſipid or taſtleſs, or acid, or bitter, or ſeverally intermixed of theſe two laſt qualities, and others which have a taſte by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſharp and ſubtle; all theſe kind of Plants are green and tender, whoſe vertue begins to appear in the prime of their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation, becauſe they do abound in Juice, which contains in it ſelf an eſſential tartarous Salt, which with time and heat thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens into a Mucilage, from whence, but with great difficulty, they cannot be ſeparated; therefore muſt they be taken whileſt they are yet juicy and tender, ſo as to break eaſily upon the leaſt bending of their ſtalk. The ſecond kind of Plants is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether oppoſite to the firſt; for, the Plant newly growing out of the ground is endued yet with little of vertue, even a good while after; for, when they are yet green and tender, they are taſtleſs and inodorous, have no taſte properly but of graſs, becauſe the ſuperfluous humour is yet predominant, and that their vertue doth not conſiſt in an eſſential tartarous Salt; but this kind of Plant carries with its natural nutriment, a ſpirituous and volatile Salt, mixt with an Embryonated Sulphur very ſubtle, which never is reduced from power into act, nor ever diſcovered by the taſte or ſmell; but after this ſuperfluous humidity is by heat
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170969:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>concocted and digeſted; then begins to appear the vertue of theſe Plants, diſcovered by the ſmell and taſte, but particularly by the ſmell. The proper time to work upon this ſecond ſort of Vegetables, is when their ſtalk begins to grow drye at the foot, when they are yet covered with flowers, and begin already to ſhew ſome little part of their ſeed. The third kind of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables is mixt and compoſed of the two firſt, for they have a taſte from the firſt moment of their vegetation: But they are without ſmell, and acquire very little when they are in their perfection; or, if they have any, it appears only when they are preſſed, grounded or rub'd with, becauſe their Sulphur is overcome by a ſlow and groſs viſcoſity, which contains much Salt, and appears by a bitter and biting taſte, or a ſweetiſh ſugared ſavour like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Honey, the Vertue of this laſt kinde, without previous digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or fermentation cannot be well extracted. Theſe Plants are to be gathered, when their flower is yet upon them, if ſo be they are bitter and without ſmell, but if they bear fruit, berries or grains, their maturity is to be expected, becauſe it is in theſe parts that the principal vertue of the whole is maintained, and it is in the center of the ſugared Muſcilage, and of a Honey na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is in theſe fruits, that an Artiſt muſt ſeek the vertue of theſe wonderfull Mixts.</p>
                              <p>Now it is not enough for us to have given theſe general no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, unleſs we make ſome particular applications, which may ſerve us for a pattern and guide upon each of theſe kinds; of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegral Plants or their parts. We ſhall then in the firſt place treat of Juicy, Nitrous Plants, that is to ſay, thoſe which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of a Salt, much of the nature of Salt-peter, or of that Salt in the Earth which is the Principle of Vegetation, and ſeems to have received yet very little of alteration in the body of theſe Plants, only that it begins already to partake a little of Tartar and its feculency.

                                 <p>We come now to the preparation of the fixed Salt; to this end you muſt dry the Cake, or remaining part of the Plant after the expreſſion of the Juice, then calcine and burn it well, untill all be reduced to whitiſh gray aſhes, whereof you muſt with river or rain-water make a Lye, which muſt be filtrated through gray Paper not much ſtiffened, that the ſtiffening or glue may not hinder your Liquor to run ſwiftly and eaſily thorough. After the firſt Lie, impregnated with the Salt of the Aſhes of the Plant, hath been filtrated, you muſt pour new water upon the Aſhes, to extract the remainder of the Salt, untill the water comes off as inſipid and voyd of taſte as it was powred firſt; which is a manifeſt and evident ſign, that no portion of Salt remains in the Aſhes, which ſeem to be no more then an uſeleſs Earth, or as ſome do call it, the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of the Plant upon which you have wrought: but I will prove the contrary nevertheleſs, by the following relation of what happened to me at <hi>Sedan,</hi> after I had wrought upon a parcel of Fennel: For, being poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of an opinion, as others are, that theſe Aſhes deveſted of their Salt were totally unuſefull, I cauſed them to be thrown away in a back-yard, where for the moſt part, Dung and other Immundicities were caſt; but the next year by what happened
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170969:97"/>unto me, I knew I was deceived; for great ſtore of Fennel grew in that yard, whereof, after it had attained to its perfection, I drew great ſtore of diſtilled Oyl; by which experiment I was taught with that excellent Philoſopher and Phyſitian <hi>Van Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> that the Median Life of things is not ſo eaſily deſtroyed as it is imagined, and that according to this Axiom of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, <hi>Formae rerum non pereunt;</hi> becauſe both the Art and Artiſt do but follow from far our Mother Nature; and this is ſufficient to convince us, that we apprehend not the leaſt of her wayes or contrivances, much leſs any of thoſe which ſhe uſes towards the attaining her own ends. But let us return to our purpoſe after this digreſſion; which, becauſe it is in its proper place, I thought more fitting to make here: After then you have gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the Lyes well filtrated, you muſt evaporate them in Jugg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mettle diſhes upon ſand, untill they thicken to a skin, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruſtate by reaſon of the Salt, which then abounds; then muſt you begin with a <hi>Spatula</hi> to ſtirr and agitate ſoftly the Liquor, untill the Salt be wholly dryed, which then being put in a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, reverberate in a Wind-furnace between kindled hot burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coals, untill it growes glowing red on all ſides, taking never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs exact heed that it melt not; this done, take off the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible from the fire, let it cool, and then diſſolve the Salt in the Extracted Water of the Plant which hath yielded the ſaid Salt, that you may once more filtrate it, purifie it, and reſtore that portion of Volatile Salt which aſcended in the diſtillation; after which, you muſt put this diſſolution in a Glaſs Cucurbit covered with its head or Limbeck, and draw off again the Water from that Salt upon Sand, untill it begins to contract a skinne, then ceaſe the fire, and put the Veſſel in ſome cool place, to cauſe the Salt to Cryſtallize, and thus continue drawing off the Water upon Sand, and cauſing the Salt to ſhoot in Cryſtals, untill it be all drawn away, and ſo ſhall you have a pure and cleanly Salt, fit for uſe when you have occaſion: but the chief uſe of it, is to put part thereof in the Water extracted from the Plant, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it thereby not only more active and efficacious, but alſo to make it more durable, fitting for keeping ſeveral yeers, without any loſs of its vertue. The proportion may be of <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ii. upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pint of diſtilled Water. The general uſe and faculty of the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170969:98"/>fixed Salts of Plants made by calcination, evaporation, reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, depuration and cryſtallization, is moderately to looſe the Belly, draw away Urines, and take off all obſtructions from the lower parts of the body: the other particular vertues may be taken or aſſigned, according to the nature of the Plant from whence they were extracted.</p>
                                 <p>And as we have declared the manner of purifying fixt Salts, ſo muſt we do alſo in ſhewing the way, of drawing off and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating a certain viſcous and coloured ſlimineſs, which is found even amongſt the Eſtential Nitro-tartareous Salts, in their firſt Cryſtallization. It is thus performed; You muſt diſſolve them in clean, common Water, and percolate three or four times upon a portion of the Aſhes of the Plant whence they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted; which is done upon two intentional ends: For, the the Artiſt muſt not work blindly, or without being capable to give an account, wherefore he doth, or doth not ſuch a thing: The firſt intention is, that the Eſſential Salt which is not yet purified, and for the moſt part is found mingled with the Extract, without having been capable to take the Idea or Character of Salt, by reaſon of the hinderance cauſed by the clammineſs of Inſpiſſated Juyces, takes in his way as it paſſes through the Aſhes the fixed Salt of its own Body, which imprints upon it its own ſaline Idea, and ſo cauſes it eaſily to cryſtallize, after the ſuperfluous Liquor is vapoured away: The ſecond intention is, that the Aſhes may preſerve the thick and clammy body of the Extract in themſelves, and ſo the Water, impregnated with the eſſential and fixt Salt of the Aſhes, may paſs cleanlier and purer by the re-iterated Percolation. This being ended, you muſt ſlowly and gently vapour away your Water in a Diſh of Jugg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mettle in Sand; not till the skin begins to cover it, as we have ſpoken when we treated of the Fixed Salts, but evaporating away the two thirds, or the three parts of the Liquor, which muſt be ſoftly and without ſhaking the bottom gently powred in a clean Earthen Diſh, ſo as if by the action of heat any ſmall Atoms or Corpuſcles ſhould happen to ſettle and make a ſediment in the bottom, they ſhould not mix with the clear Liquor, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the purity of Cryſtallization in the Salt. The water which ſhal ſwim above the Cryſtals, muſt be drawn off, and the Evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170969:98"/>re-iterated, untill half of the Liquor be conſumed away: and ſo continue till you have got all your Salt turn'd to Cryſtals. And if ſo be this way of Purification doth not ſatisfie the Artiſt, and that the Cryſtals want the cleanlineſs and tranſparency de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; he ſhall put them in a Crucible made of the leaſt porous Earth which is to be found, and let him melt his Salt in a Wind-furnace, that the fire of Fuſion may conſume all what may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cryſtallization to be done with the requiſite cleanlineſs and tranſparency: this Salt being ſo melted, muſt be poured in a very clean braſs Mortar, warmed a little before, that the too violent heat of the melted Salt ſhould not cleave or ſplit it; when it is cooled, diſſolve it in a ſufficient quantity of the Water diſtilled from the Hearb whereof the Salt is extracted; but the quantity of Water muſt not exceed that of the Salt; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the third part or half muſt be drawn again by Diſtillation, or Evaporation; whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Eſſential Salt muſt be dried between two Papers, then be put in a well ſtopt Glaſs-bottle to preſerve for uſe: It hath the vertue to preſerve as well the Water of the diſtilled Plant as the fixed Salt; and moreover, makes it diuretical, aperitive, and cooling, much better then the Mineral common Cryſtal made with Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter.

The reaſon is, becauſe the other had not in themſelves that ſaline, ſubtile and Vol tile Salt, which eaſily vapours and flies away, if the Artiſt doth not uſe great induſtry, and take the nick of time to preſerve it; for, if too much time be ſpent, from the gathering of theſe Plants to the making uſe of them, their Spirit doth eaſily contract a heat, and being volatilized by the ſame, doth flie away, and the body of the Plant remains rotten and uſeleſs.

Herein the Chymical Artiſt needs properly his niceſt judgement, to take the true nick of time of this ſoft and amicable heat, becauſe if this degree of heat doth exceed, it volatilizes too ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, the Spirit and ſubtile parts of the Plants upon which he doth work; which, notwithſtanding all care and precaution, eaſily vapours and vaniſhes away, for all is converted afterwards into an unpleaſant acidity, which contains no more of the Volatile Spirit: And if this heat, on the other ſide, is leſs than it ought to be, it doth not ſufficiently help the Leaven or Ferment, to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170969:100"/>diſſolve and divide the moſt ſolid parts of the Plant, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain yet in themſelves a Centrical Salt, contributing very much to the perfection of the Spirit which is to be extracted out of the Plant; and moreover helps not a little to diſunite the viſcoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Juyce of the Plant, which contains in it ſelf the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal portion of the Eſſential Volatile Salt, which affords the Spirit; nevertheleſs, it is ſafer to fail in the defect then in the exceſs. Things being put in this temper, Take Barm, or Beer-yeſt, if you are in a convenient place to recover it; if not, raiſe Flower diſſolved in Water ſomething leſs then luke-warm, with about <abbr>lb</abbr> ſs. of Leaven or Ferment commonly uſed every where for Dow in the making of Bread: and when the Liquor is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed and puft, and the flower hath got on the top of the Liquor, heed muſt be had when the top of the Flower begins to crack, for it is a token that the Fermenting Spirit is ſufficiently excited, to be reduced from power into act, and to be introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the matter, ready to be fermented: but you muſt note, that your Veſſel is not to be more then half filled, otherwiſe all will run out and fly away, by reaſon of the action of the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which by an internal motion agitates and elevates the matters, and in which motion doth conſiſt the power both of Nature and Art. This firſt Heat of Ebullition being paſt, the Artiſt muſt ſuffer the Ferment to act ſoftly and by degrees, untill he perceives that all that Cruſt which the Fermenting Spirit had raiſed up, and framed out of the moſt corporeal and material ſubſtance, to be as a Wall or Defence againſt the evaſion or evaporation of the acting Spirits, begins of it ſelf to ſubſide, and precipitate it ſelf, becauſe it is no longer ſupported by the activity of the Spirits; this moſt commonly doth happen at the end of two or three dayes in Summer, and four or five in Winter. Here again muſt the Artiſt be very carefull to take his time, for as ſoon as this ſign begins to appear, he muſt diſtill his fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted matter, unleſs by his own ſloth and neglect, he will loſe what Art and Nature had prepared to his hand; for, at that time this Fermented Spirit eaſily vaniſhes, and what remains is no more then an acid, uſeleſs and unprofitable Liquor.

If he will rectifie this Spirit, he muſt diſtill it again in <hi>B.

                                 <p>There will be no need of making any great diſcourſe by it ſelf, whereby to give to underſtand how the little Centaury, Wormwood, Rhue, Penny-royal, Balm, Mint, Flowers of lime-tree, and other Plants of this nature; which in themſelves have no moiſture when they are poſſeſſed with their vertue, and fit to be uſed, are to be gathered. They are only to be groſly bruiſed in a Mortar after they are cut, and you have added to each <abbr>lb</abbr> of the Plant (which you purpoſe to ferment and diſtil thereby, to extract the Spirit) x <abbr>lb</abbr> of water, as we have already related above, obſerving all the notes and hints alſo given, which are eſſentially neceſſary to the true ordering of fermentation. But in caſe you purpoſe only in your diſtillation to extract hereby the aetherial Oyl, and ſpirituous Water of the Plant, you muſt only diſtil the ſame Plant without any previous infuſion, macera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and much leſs fermentation, being ſhred very ſmall, putting to each <abbr>lb</abbr> of plant x <abbr>lb</abbr> of Water.</p>
                                 <p>There is yet notwithſtanding a way to preſerve Plants of this nature, and even the Flowers themſelves, and cauſe them to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without any other addition of mixture: And herein alſo is the Artiſt to take great heed, and to be very circumſpect: for, unleſs you will loſe time and labour, not one of the circumſtances which we ſhall now relate, is to be omitted. Proceed then as it followeth; Gather the Plant or Flower when they are in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; to this purpoſe muſt the Plant be in a ſtate between Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Seed; and if it bears no Seed, or be only a Flower, it muſt be in the height of its ſmell, and the leaves muſt firmly hold to their ſtalks: But the principal Note beſides, is, the time of gathering, which is, to gather theſe things a little after the riſing of the Sun, that the dew may not be upon them, which would cauſe corruption; they muſt not alſo be gathered after a rainy-day, or the day before, whereby they might have contracted ſuperfluous moiſture, which would cauſe the ſame accident. Having theſe Plants thus conditionated, you muſt fill great Pots or Veſſels of Jugge-metal therewith, well cleanſed and dryed, and thruſt them in very hard; leaving no empty ſpace, but only ſo much as will

                                 <p>Of theſe Plants when you intend to prepare any, being in its ſtate and ſtrength, that is, when the Flower is fully blown, but not yet grown to Seed, at that time which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> cals <hi>Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miticum tempus,</hi> the Balſamick time. <hi>i. e.</hi> a little before the riſing of the Sun, becauſe in this operation is needful, that ſweet and pleaſant humor which Plants do in the night time attract from the dew, by the magnetical and natural vertue wherewith they are endowed to recruit themſelves with the neceſſary moiſture as much for their ſubſiſtance and ſelf-preſervation, as to reſiſt the Suns heat, which by day time ſucks and dryeth them: when you have a ſufficient quantity of the Plant you intend to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, beat it in a Marble Mortar, and reduce it to an in palpable Pap, as near as you can; then put this Pap in a long-neckt-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſs thermetically ſealed to digeſt in Horſe dung, the ſpace of a Philoſophical month, which is forty natural dayes; or elſe put the Veſſel in a vaporous Bath, wrapt up in ſawings of Wood, or minced ſtraw during the ſame time, and in a heat analogous to that of Horſe-dung.

This Remedy may be taken in white Wine, Broth, decoction or ſome kind of Water, which may ſerve as a vehicle to the Medicine, to render it more active and penetrating by the ſubtility of its parts, even into the laſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, to expel the evil, obnoxious, and uſeleſs part thereof, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore decayed ſtrength, and finally bring Nature back again into his true path, to direct the health and preſervation of every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual ſubject.</p>

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170969:104"/>great Philoſopher concludes his Treatiſe by the method of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Quinteſſences of four ſeveral ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Quinteſſences of Minerals; precious Stones; Plants and Liquors, which are Sulphurs and Bitumens: he hath not been contented with a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Diſcourſe of the poſſibility of renewing and repairing our internal and external defects; but hath alſo added the practice and way of operation, upon ſeveral matters, to extract the Quinteſſences thereof, and finally doth conclude, by the manner of uſing the ſame to attain renovation of nature. He ſaith then, that it will ſuffice, to put as much of this precious liquor in white Wine, as there will be need to colour it with a colour neer that of the remedy; and thereof give a Glaſs every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſting to him, or her which ſhall feel a deficiency by age, or infirmity of ſickneſs. Moreover, he gives the ſigns of the beginning and progreſs of this renewing, and the time when the uſe of this admirable Medicine muſt be put by: for, he thought it unneceſſary, to mention the ſigns and obſervations which are to be heeded, when it is taken for ſome ſenſible and apparent diſeaſe; ſince it neceſſarily follows, that the uſe thereof muſt be continued, until the Patient finds alleviatior, or the diſeaſe falls away, and then muſt ceaſe conſequently the uſe of the Remedy. But as for the ſigns of renewing, he delivers them in a judicious order, as if he would prevent the incredulity of thoſe which know not the power nor ſphere of activity of the vertue and efficacy which God hath placed in natural Beeings, when by the help of Art they are reduced to their univerſal Principle without loſs of their ſeminal goodneſs: or to prevent alſo the aſtoniſhment of thoſe which ſhall make uſe of it, ſince what ordinarily happens, in the taking of this Remedy, cauſes no little ſurpriſal, when the perſon that uſes theſe Remedies, ſees in the firſt place all his nails fall off from feet and hands, and next all the hair of the body, and then the teeth; and laſt of all, the skin to ſhrink and wrinckle, and drying inſenſibly to fall as all the reſt, which are all the ſigns he gives of internal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, by that which is performed outwardly: For, it is as if he would inſinuate, and give us to underſtand, that of all neceſſity, the medicine muſt have penetrated through all the body, and repleniſhed it with new vigour, ſince the external parts
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170969:104"/>which are inſenſible, and as the excrements of our digeſtions fall of themſelves without any pain: But you muſt note, that he cauſes the uſe of the Remedy to be intermitted, when the laſt ſign, <hi>viz.</hi> the drying of the skin doth appear, the wrinckles and the falling thereof, becauſe it is an univerſal ſign, that the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of renewing hath ſufficiently extended it ſelf through the whole habit of the body, which the skin generally covers over, and that ſo it was neceſſary, that this old rind ſhould fall, and another grow in the place, becauſe the firſt was not ſufficiently porous, or permeable, to cauſe the natural heat which is renewed, to drive outwardly all the ſupe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I will, to convince them, bring here two remarkable examples; the one drawn from what naturally happens every year, by the renewing of ſome kind of creatures in one ſeaſon of the year only; the other from a true Hiſtory of what happened to one of my beſt friends, which took Quinteſſence of Balm Mint to a woman paſt the age of ſixty, which took ſome alſo; and finally, to a Hen which did eat Corn ſteeped in ſome drops of the ſame Quinteſſence.</p>
                                 <p>As for the firſt example, there is none but knows the renewing of the Stags-head, as alſo the skin of Serpents and Vipers; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning that of the Bird, called by the <hi>Latines, Halcyo,</hi> or the Kings-Fiſher, the Hiſtory of whom <hi>Paracelſus</hi> makes in the Tract before-mentioned. But of all thoſe which agree in the fact, very few do know, or care to know how, and by what means, or for what reaſon it is done. For firſt, as for the Serpents in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, it is to be conſidered, they remain hid under ground, or in the holes of Trees and Rocks, or lodg'd among rubbiſh and ſtones, from the end of Autumn, until very far in the Spring, and ſo during that time, they are as benummed &amp; dead; their skins become thick
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170969:105"/>and hard, and loſes even its poroſity to preſerve the better the Animal whom it incompaſſes; for, if there happened a continual tranſpiration, there would be alſo a deperdition of ſubſtance: now after the Serpents are in the Spring of the year got out of their holes, and have begun to feed, and live upon the tender ends of Herbs, in which is a renewing vertue: this creature being imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately excited by a pricking and ſhooting which ſhe feels about the compaſs of the head, by reaſon of the Spirits heated and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by this natural remedy, ſhe rubs and beſtirs herſelf, until ſhe hath got off her old skin from about her head, which ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to do all the reſt of the day, till ſhe hath caſt away all her old garment; which was not only needleſs, but want of poroſity and tranſpirability might have ſuffocated her. Then doth ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear all glorious, and as it were renewed; which is perceived not only by the difference between the ſlow and lazie motion of thoſe which are not renewed, from thoſe which have caſt their skins; whoſe motion is ſo quick and nimble, that eaſily they ſcape our ſight. And moreover, the skin of the old ones is deformed, and of an earthly colour; whereas the other, to the contrary, is poliſht, fair, ſhining and well coloured. As for the Stags, the caſting of their head is done in another way, and for another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then that of the Serpents: for, that Creature doth not hide it ſelf in the ground; nor renews not all its external parts, ſince he caſts nothing off but his head in the Spring: but the reaſon is his being, during Winter, deprived of ſufficient nouriſhment, and made unable to maintain this wonderful production he bears up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head ſince even he wants a due ſupply for his own ſubſiſtence and life; then ſay the Huntſmen, that the Stag (by a Galliciſm) is faln into poverty, which is perceived not only by his leanneſs and weakneſs, but chiefly alſo by the head which becomes dry, ſpongious and deſtituted of ſap, becauſe this Animal hath not a ſufficient vigour, to impart a ſpirituous and ſaline nouriſhment to the head, by reaſon of its want of food, as we have ſaid even now; now, it is this nouriſhment, which gives ſtrength, vigour, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance to the Stags head; for which reaſon, when in the Spring, a good and juicie nouriſhment animates, and heats its body, it cauſes now vegetation in all its parts, and conſequently, and chiefly, in the head, which makes him to caſt it off. We ſhall ſay no more
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170969:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>of this renovation, and of the vertue contained in the new Stags-head, and that which is already grown to conſiſtency and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe we have ſufficiently made mention thereof in the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical preparation of Animals and their parts.</p>
                                 <p>But let us come now to the Experimental proof of Renovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on begun by the uſe of a Quinteſſence, by the relation of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory we have promiſed above, and which happened thus. After one of my beſt friends had prepared a Quinteſſence of Balm mixt, and that all the tokens and alterations which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, had ſucceeded according to his hopes, and the truth of the remedy, he could not have a full and true ſatisfaction in his mind, unleſs he made the proof of this great <hi>Arcanum;</hi> to be more fully and better perſwaded of the verity of the thing, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of the Authour he had followed: and as he knew that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly experiments made upon other bodies will be defective, he made it upon himſelf, and an old woman-ſervant he had by him, of about 70. years of age, in the ſame houſe where he lived; and a Hen bred in the ſame place. He then for about 15 dayes, took every day faſting, a glaſs of white Wine coloured with this Remedy; and the very firſt day, the nails of hands and feet begun to ſeparate themſelves from the skin, without any grief or pain, and ſo continued ſtill caſting, until they fell off them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without help. I confeſs unto you, that his conſtancy was not great enought, to go through all his Experiment, and that he thought himſelf ſufficiently convinced by this that happened, without being obliged to try any further concluſions upon his own perſon. Therefore he gave every morning ſome of this Wine to this old Woman; who did drink not above 10. or 12. days, and before this time was expired, her monthly courſes came back with a laudable colour, and broke out in a conſiderable quantity, enough to fright her, and make her believe it would be her death; not knowing ſhe had took a remedy capable to renew her to youth; upon which account alſo, my friend durſt not proceed further, as much by reaſon of the fear which had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the old Woman, as by reaſon of what had happened unto him.

Thus much I had to relate upon this ſubject, whereof I draw the following conſequences.</p>
                                 <p>I believe, there is none of ſo perverted a reaſon and depraved intellectuals, which doth not eaſily conceive, that ſince Nature teaches us by all her operations, that to maintain life in living bodies, with all the neceſſary functions of the parts which conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute them, their poroſity muſt be preſerved; ſo muſt of neceſſity Art, which is but imitator of Nature, do the ſame to maintain and reſtore the health of Individuals, committed to her care and cuſtody. Whence I do infer conſequently, that the Phyſitian and Chymical Artiſt, ought perpetually to endeavour, by the Anatomy which they make of natural Mixts, to diſcover that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, volatile, penetrating and active part, which is not corroſive, but to the contrary, friendly to our Nature, and may only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance her birth or delivery without conſtraint: And, as I know that there is nothing but the volatile ſulphureous Salts, which may have the power of acting in the manner we have ſaid; ſo muſt they apply all their underſtanding, to ſeparate this amiable and friendly agent, and nevertheleſs very efficacious, and untye it as it were from the commerce of the groſs and material body; if they will be the true imitators of Nature, which ever makes uſe of this ſame agent, to conduct all animated bodies to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their natural predeſtination, unleſs ſhe be hindered by ſome occaſional external or internal cauſe, which ordinarily does inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the order, oenonomy, and guidance of her ſecret motions, which preſerves the lovely harmony of all animated compounds. This <hi>Paracelſus</hi> hath done, teaching us the manner how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Liquors and Quinteſſences: becauſe, this operations ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the ſubtile part from the groſs; preſerves &amp; exalts the ſeminal faculties of the compound, until it hath rendred it capable to correct and amend the defects of natural functions; that imitating
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170969:106"/>the example of this great ſearcher of Nature, and according to the Ideas by us given in this Diſcourſe, before we come to the particulars of the parts of Vegetables, and all the operations to which they are lyable by the proceſſes of Chymiſtry; all thoſe that ſhall really addict themſelves to theſe noble operations, may be prevented with a general knowledge of their parts, whether groſs or ſubtile, and conducted alſo and regulated in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and actions, according to the notions and theorems we have imparted, which they may by the direction of their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions appropriate to each Vegetable in particular, that ſo the Artiſt may ſatisfie the expectation others have of her, and himſelf alſo, to the illuſtrating and innobling his Profeſſion; and, that which muſt be his principal end, to the preſervation and reſtorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his neighbours health.</p>

                              <p>WE have ſufficiently, in my opinion, inſinuated the various nature of Plants, and the difference of their parts, in the fore-going Diſcourſe, to prepare the mind of our Artiſt, to an acknowledgement of that truth we are now to declare, in that which we now begin, to correct and reform; and, if it be poſſible, take away the abuſe and evil preparation, which the greateſt part of Apothecaries do practiſe, when they work upon Syrups, which are either plain or ſingle, or compounded: and are nothing elſe, but Sugar or Honey boyled to a certain liquid conſiſtency, either with diſtilled Waters or Juyces, or with decoctions alſo of whole Plants, or of their own parts, as leaves, flowers, fruits, ſeeds and roots. But, as we have taught above, the divers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe parts, to be taken notice of by the Artiſt when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to diſtil them; ſo do we refer there alſo the Apothecary, which pretends to Chymiſtry to be inſtructed in the way of his operation, when he intends to make his Syrups either ſingle or compounded. Nevertheleſs, as I know, that all Diſpenſatories are defective, and commit the ſame faults in the preparation of their Syrups, and that but one Hermetical Phyſitian hath attempted to correct them; I think my ſelf obliged to follow the example
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170969:107"/>of Mr. <hi>Swelfer</hi> Phyſitian to the Emperour, which hath made very learned Notes, upon all the defects of the antient Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy: but as he writes in <hi>Latin,</hi> and doth reaſon as an Herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Philoſopher, I have thought my ſelf obliged to direct into the right way, thoſe which either through want of that language, or of skill in Chymiſtry, to apprehend the ſenſe of ſo learned an Authour, do ſtride, and go out of it: Moreover to exhort thoſe, which are endowed with the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue, and have ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of being skill'd in the Myſteries of Chymiſtry, not to bury their talent, but rather improve it to the advancement and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of ſick people, the diſcharge of their conſcience, and particular benefit.</p>
                              <p>We muſt notwithſtanding ſet down here, ſome few examples of faults committed heretofore in this part of practice, prove the Error, want of a true apprehenſion of the things; and finally teach the way how to do better, adjoyning poſitive reaſons, which may have their foundation in the thing it ſelf and the manner of working, and why that operation proves better, and is more ſucceſsful.</p>
                              <p>Before we come to the proof to which we have engaged our ſelves, it is neceſſary we ſhould ſhow the ſcope both of ancient and modern Apothecaries in the compoſition of their Syrups, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſingle or compounded, whereof they have left us the deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions in their Antidotaries and Diſpenſatories. All the true ſons of Art, have from all time held this Maxim; that in all Remedies three conditions were required, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ſhould be capable to operate quickly, ſafely, and pleaſantly, <hi>citò, tutò, jucundè:</hi> Moreover, another of their endeavours was, that, what they did prepare, might preſerve for ſome time its own vertue within it ſelf, to be uſed when opportunity ſhould offer. Upon this ground have they brought in Sugar and Honey, ſeparated, or both together, in the compoſition of their Syrups, and other Remedies of the like nature. So then have they made uſe of theſe two Subſtances as of two Balſamick Salts, which might be fit to receive and preſerve the vertue of diſtilled waters: as that of Roſe-water in their Syrup, or Alexandrine Julip: that of the Juyces of Plants or Fruits, as that of Wine, Vinegar, Juyce of Quinces, Limons, Oranges, Pomgranats, and many other, in

But, as the greateſt part of thoſe, who have pretended to will, and to be capable to teach Apothecaries, their Art and <hi>modus faciendi,</hi> have been igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant themſelves in the differences or diſtinguiſhing of their matter, and want of being vers't in Chymical operations, have not known the ſeveral wayes of extracting their vertue without loſs; ſo is it not to be admired, if Apothecaries who have followed them, and every day yet follow them, are fallen into groſſer Errors then themſelves, ſince for the moſt part they perform but very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly what they find in their Books.</p>
                              <p>Our refuge then muſt be to Chymical Phyſick, which ſhall preſcribe us the rules that from henceforth may hinder Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Apothecaries, if they will be guided by them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the like faults, and if they benefit themſelves by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and doctrine which we are about now to preſcribe them, whereby methodically to prepare the ſingle and compounded Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups, without loſing any pottion of that vertue which reſides in volatile ſulphureous Salt, and the mixt Salt of Mixts preſcribed by their Diſpenſatories.</p>
                              <p>We ſhall begin by plain Syrups, and that by degrees: and firſt, by thoſe which are compounded of juyces already depurated of themſelves, or which may be ſeparated without fear, that fermentation ſhould be obnoxious to them, ſuch as are acid juyces. Then will we treat of ſuch Syrups, as are made with the juyces extracted from Plants, and thoſe of two natures; <hi>viz.</hi> Some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of odour, and participating of a vitriolick tartarous taſt; the other are odoriferous, and participating of a volatile ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Salt: theſe two ſorts of Juyces need a quick and nimble Eye, and much induſtry of the Artiſt in the ſeparation of their impurities, without any loſs of their faculties and vertues, before Syrups are made of it; which without the Precepts of Chymiſtry,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170969:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>an Apothecary will never be able to perform, then will we end this matter, by demonſtrating the faults hitherto committed, in the preparation of Compounded Syrups, whereof we will give ſome Examples, that all may be made more ſenſible and manifeſt, to him that hath a deſire to improve his knowledge and skill in his Operation.</p>

                                 <p>It ſeems at firſt ſight that this Preſcription is all full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, clear, and agreeable to the rules of Arr and Nature; but our Chymical examining thereof, will make it appear, that there are more faults therein then words, and that it is all full of abſurdities, even unworthy of a Chymical Novice, and ſo by conſequent much more of ſo famous and renowned an <hi>Arabick</hi> Phyſician as <hi>Meſue</hi> was, to whom the invention of this Syrup is attributed.</p>
                                 <p>But before we come to note the imperfections of this proceſs, we muſt declare what vertues <hi>Meſue</hi> and his Sectators have attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to this Syrup, and the <hi>Oxymel Simplex,</hi> and for which Diſeaſes he deſtinated it, becauſe it will not give a ſmall light, to diſcover, how falſe and ill grounded are the indications which they have taken, want of knowing well the nature of things, and being vers'd in the Operations of Chymiſtry.</p>
                                 <p>They attribute, and not without ſome ground and reaſon, to this Syrup, the faculty and vertue of inciſing, attenuating, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mundifying; that of refrigerating and tempering the heats proceeding from choler, that of reſiſting to putrefaction and corruptions, and finally of expelling the Urine, and provoking ſweat. I confeſs all theſe vertues may poſſibly be in this Syrup, when rightly prepared: but unleſs it be after our preſcriptions declared hereafter, it will poſſeſs thoſe eminent and ſignal ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
                                 <p>I have taken the deſcription of this Syrup from the <hi>Aupsburg</hi>

What, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, is there worſe digeſted, than to preſcribe to boyl <abbr>lb</abbr> v. Sugar, with <abbr>lb</abbr> iii. water, upon a fire of kindled and flaming Coals, and skimming perpetually to the conſumption of half the ſubſtance, without a previous Clarification, and then to add iij. or iiij <abbr>lb</abbr> Vinegar, to reduce the whole into a Syrup, ſince Vinegar doth alſo participate of its impurities and froth, and ſo puts the Artiſt to a new skimming. This is, notwithſtanding, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <hi>Baudero.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Others have not ſped better with their clarified Sugar, and deſerve no leſs reprehenſion; for Experience it ſelf doth contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict what they pretend to: For, this Axiom which ſaith, <hi>Fruſtra fit per plura quod fieri poteſt per pauciora, aequè bene vel melius;</hi> ſhewes evidently, that it is very ill done, to put <abbr>lb</abbr> iiij. of Water, with the Sugar and Vinegar, to reduce them to Syrup; ſince, beſides that water is here altogether needleſs, I ſay even that for two reaſons it is abſolutely prejudicial: The firſt, becauſe the ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Water cauſes a great loſs of time, which a good Artiſt ought to value; the ſecond, and which is yet much more conſiderable, is, becauſe the Water doth in the action of boyling too long, carry away in its ſteem, the moſt ſubtle, volatile, and ſaline parts of the Vinegar, from which proceeds the inciſive and aperitive vertue, which is proper and ſpecifical to this Syrup. For, I would fain know, what <abbr>lb</abbr> iiij. of Water can avail to this Syrup, or what vertue communicate unto the ſame: For, if it be anſwered, To advance the depuration of the Sugar, and that it was the intention of <hi>Baudero:</hi> I will ask the reaſon alſo, why the <hi>Diſpenſatory</hi> of <hi>Augsburg,</hi> doth alſo preſcribe the ſame <abbr>lb</abbr> iiij. of Water, ſince it preſcribes to take clarified Sugar; which makes me to conclude, that neither the one nor the other had any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for what they did. Therefore, thoſe that will prepare this Syrup as it ſhould be, with all the vertues and faculties neceſſary unto the ſame, to follow and anſwer the intention of Phyſitians, muſt proceed after the following rule.</p>
                                 <p>℞ an earthen white Diſh, or Jugg-mettle glaſed, which place
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170969:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>upon a Kettle or Cauldron of boyling water, which we will call a boyling <hi>B.

I leave now the Reader to his free choyce and judgment, of making this Syrup after the ancient or modern way, and I know that the knowing Artiſt, will ever follow that reaſon and experience which guides him to operate <hi>citiùs, tutiùs, et jucundiùs;</hi> that is to ſay, in the quickeſt, ſafeſt and pleaſanteſt manner: to ſhew that <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry</hi> is, and ever ſhall be the faireſt and beſt School of <hi>Pharmacy.</hi> To conclude this examination, note in the way, that ℥ ix. of clear Liquor by it ſelf, or according to the preſcriptions of Art, are ſufficient to reduce <abbr>lb</abbr> i. to a conſiſtency of Syrup, by a ſimple diſſolution in the heat of the Vaporous Bath; that this may be as a general note, when we come to ſpeak of the other Syrups, either plain or compounded, hereafter.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>The general method of making Syrups of Acid things, Fruits, as are thoſe of Juice of Lemmons, Oranges, Cherries, Pomgranates, Barberries, Quinces, Gooſeberries, Strawberries, Apples,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                                 <p>WE have not much to note, upon the preparation of theſe Syrups, becauſe the vulgar Pharmacy doth commit leſs faults in them; yet as there is ſome ſmall obſervations we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count neceſſary to the inſtructing of our Chymical Apothecary, we would not paſs them by.</p>
                                 <p>Take then of all theſe Fruits which you pleaſe, and thereof expreſs the Juyce according to Art, and the nature of each in particular; with this precaution, to make uſe of no Metallick Veſſel to receive them; taking alſo great care to ſeparate the grains and ſeeds of theſe fruits, becauſe ſome of them are better, and other mucilagineous and ſlimy; and ſo would impart an ill taſte to the Juyces, or a ſlimineſs and viſcoſity, which would
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170969:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>be prejudicial to the perfecting of the Syrup: And as for thoſe Fruits which muſt be ſcraped, to expreſs the Juyce thereof, you muſt have Scrapers of Silver, or Letton well blanched and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; for, Iron doth eaſily communicate its taſte and colour, to the ſubſtance of any acid Fruit, as alſo Copper or Letton. All this being exactly obſerved, let thoſe Juyces, which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are liquid, to depurate, untill they have depoſited a ſlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or a ground of certain Corpuſcles, which are to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by filtration. But as touching the Juyces of ſuch Fruits, which are of a ſoft, ſlow, and viſcous ſubſtance, they muſt be put in a cold place to ſettle, and, as it were, ferment a little, and then the pureſt Liquor ſo clarified of it ſelf, and ſwimming above the reſt, let be ſeparated; becauſe if you proceed otherwiſe, there will rather come a Jelly then a Syrup.</p>
                                 <p>After all theſe Juyces have duely been prepared in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as we have now deducted, they muſt be put in a Glaſs Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbit in <hi>B. M.</hi> and evaporated to the conſumption of ⅓ p. or ¼ neither ought you to fear, that by this proceſs any portion of the ſharpneſs of the Juyce ſhould be loſt, ſince to the contrary it will encreaſe it; the acid or ſharp quality remaining ever the laſt, and nothing vapours away but the phlegm, or unneceſſary wateriſhneſs, and moreover this Operation will ſerve to ſeparate the remainder of the feculencies abiding in the Juyce: For it is a thing worthy to be noted, that two hours of digeſtion in <hi>B. M.</hi> will ſooner depurate a Juyce, then three dayes of inſolation of the ſame; and, that which is yet more remarkable, the Juyces ſo depurated will ſeldom viny, and may be much longer preſerved then others, without any alteration: As for the preparation of the Syrup, you muſt follow the <hi>modus faciendi,</hi> which we have heretofore preſcribed to the Acetous Syrup, <hi>viz.</hi> ℞ ℥ ix. of well prepared Juyce, againſt <abbr>lb</abbr> j. of powedered Sugar, or the ſame quantity of Sugar boyled into a ſolid Electuary or <hi>Roſat</hi> Sugar, diſſolve them in the heat of a Vaporous Bath, in Earthen glazed, or Glaſs Veſſels, noting ſtill, when you work upon Acids, never to uſe Metal.</p>

                                 <head>How the Juyces and Syrups of Plants of the ſecond Claſſis ſhall be prepared.</head>
                                 <p>THE Juyces of theſe Plants muſt be extracted with the ſame precautions we have taught, when we ſpoke of the ſpirits of Plants, their diſtilled Waters and their extracts, whereto we refer the Artiſt, to avoid needleſs and tedious repetitions. But as I have already often ſaid, that Antiſcorbutical Plants were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſubtle parts, and had in themſelves a ſaline Spirit, which is volatile, mercurial, and ſulphureous, which eaſily vaniſhes and flyes away: ſo muſt the Chymical Apothecary carefully and diligently work in their Preparation after he hath once begun, that by his careleſneſs he may not loſe, what he ought with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and ſtudy to preſerve, and can no more be recovered when once fled away. Here is then the only difference, between the preparation of theſe Juyces and Syrups, and the fore-going. That when you diſtil them in <hi>B. M.</hi> you muſt have a judicious regard, to ſet a part ℥ v. of the firſt Water which will aſcend out of every pound of Juyce, becauſe theſe ℥ v. ſhall have carryed away with themſelves the portion of the Spirit and volatile Salt of ℥ i. Juyce: then continue your diſtillation, until you have drawn away the half of the liquor or moiſture of your Juyce; then ceaſe, and to <abbr>lb</abbr> i. of this Juyce, put <abbr>lb</abbr> i. <hi>ſs.</hi> of Sugar boyled to a conſiſtency of Sugar Roſat, and reduce it unto Syrup, by a ſimple diſſolution in cold, with vi. or vij. ℥ of the ſpirituous and ſubtle Water which firſt aſcended, and hath been kept for this purpoſe; ſo ſhall you have a Syrup filled with all the vertues of its Mixt, as eaſily it
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170969:111"/>will appear, and manifeſtly, by the odour and the taſt: but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, by all the noble Effects it will produce in all Scorbutical diſeaſes, whether you give it ſingle or mixed, with the ſecond Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you have preſerved. You may alſo preſerve theſe Juyces for ſervice, when there ſhall be need in the time that Plants are out of ſeaſon and vigour, uſing ſuch precaution and fore-caſt as is in ſuch a caſe required.</p>

                                 <head>How the Juyces and Syrups of Plants of the third Claſſis, ſhall be prepared.</head>
                                 <p>WE will not here loſe time with vain and empty repetitions, ſince it ſuffices us to ſay, that the Artiſt muſt duly prepare his Juyce, to ground his operation upon, as we are now going to declare. When you have the Juyce of any of theſe odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous Plants, you muſt depurate it by a ſingle and ſlow digeſtion in <hi>B. M.</hi> to ſeparate the feces and skum which ſwims on the top. This Juyce being percolated cold through a Flannel, ℞ <abbr>lb</abbr> iiij. thereof, and place it in a Cucurbit, with a blind head over it, or in a double veſſel exactly joyned: put in this juyce <abbr>lb</abbr> i. ſs. of the tops and flowers of the ſame Plant, not beaten in the Mortar, but only cut very ſmall with Cizzars; then cloſe the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and lute them with a bladder ſteept in beaten whites of Eggs, and place it 24 hours in a ſlow heat of <hi>B. M.</hi> After which take away the covering of the Veſſel, and apply to it a Head. Limbeck to extract out of this Juyce impregnated with the new vertue and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of it Plants ℥ xx. of ſpirituous and very odoriferous water, this ended, ceaſe the fire, and expreſs what remains in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Cucurbit, and preſerve it for this following purpoſe: Put the xx ℥ of odoriferous Water in a double Glaſs, or blind Head, to which you ſhall add ℥ x. more, of the new tops of the Plant upon which you work; which lute and cauſe to digeſt in the ſlow heat of <hi>B. M.</hi> during a natural day; then being let cool, expreſs it ſoftly, that it may not grow thick or muddy, and keep it till you have cauſed that which did remain with the grounds of your expreſſion to boyl, and clarified it with white of Eggs, and boyled with <abbr>lb</abbr> iij. of Sugar, into conſiſtency of Lozenges, which you muſt melt in the cold, or only in luke-warm water,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170969:111"/>with the twenty ounces of your odoriferous Water, containing the Mumial and Balſamical vertue of the Plant; and thus ſhall you have a Syrup, in which nothing of what ſhould be in ſhall be wanting, to follow clearly the intention of Art and Nature. But me thinks, I hear the moſt part of Apothecaries alleadging, that this is a way to lengthen the method of making Syrups, and that no body will care for rewarding the trouble which they will be at, in this exact way of operation: Moreover, that they muſt be obliged to be at the charge of a <hi>Balneum Maris</hi> and Glaſs Veſſels, which are neceſſary to digeſtion and diſtillation, that theſe Veſſels are brickle; and that, all things thus conſidered and caſt up together, the price of their remedies muſt then be ſet at higher rates: and beſides this, that others which are not ſo circumſpect, will give their Syrups at the common rates, and that people run moſt commonly where they find things cheaper, without examining the worth or goodneſs of them; and that this is the way to ruine their ſhops quickly, and loſe cuſtomers. To all theſe objections, which are not without ſome ground, we anſwer, Firſt, as concerning the <hi>Balneum Maris,</hi> it hath no ſuch matter to be ſtarted at in it ſelf, but the name, to ſuch as know the nature thereof: for a Kettle only may be made uſe of to all the purpoſes and neceſſary uſes of their ſhops. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Concerning the Veſſels, What Artiſt is not obliged to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with them for other diſtillations, if they will duly diſcharge their Calling, or at leaſt make a ſhow thereof? And if they fear breaking, they may have Cucurbits of Jugge-mettle, or white Earth for acid ſubſtances, and of Copper tinned for other matters; but this will not be without ſome inconveniency, in reſpect that they ſhall not be able to judge of the depuration of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, nor the remaining quantity or conſiſtency, where theſe things are to be obſerved, by reaſon of the opacity of their Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. But the laſt conſideration is prevalent over all the reſt; and that is, that every one is obliged by the Oath he hath taken in his admiſſion to the Profeſſion of Pharmacy, to exerciſe it with all care and exactneſs,, and the diſcharge of his Conſcience. This laſt ſcope then muſt prevail over all the reſt, and be inſtead of a ſpur and bait of well doing: for thereby ſhall they find the recommendation of Phyſitians; and their candour and aſſiduity
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170969:112"/>being known, will draw upon them the eſteem and affections of ſuch as do love the preſervation of their preſent, and reſtoring of their paſt health. Let us then go on in diſcovering ſome more of the Errors of ancient Pharmacy, and being not contented to prove they have done ill, let us ſhow how they may do better. To this end, we will deliver three examples more, of ſingle Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups, <hi>viz.</hi> of odoriferous Flowers, of Rinds of the ſame nature, and of aromatical Subſtances: That when Apothecaries ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare any Syrups of this kind, their ſhops may not be ſmelt, at three or four hundred yards diſtance, which is an infallible token of the deperdition of the Eſſential vertue of the Volatile and Sulphurous parts of the Flowers, odoriferous Rinds, and aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Subſtances wrought upon: unleſs theſe Apothecaries by a vain and prepoſterous policy, and very prejudicial to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and themſelves, take a delight in having their ſhops ſmelt from a far off. And as contra ies by the oppoſition of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries are more illuſtrated; we ſhall firſt declare, how the fault is committed, ſecondly, wherefore; to teach in the third place, and explain to the underſtanding Reader how to do better.</p>

It is then attributed to this Syrup, marvellouſly to recreate the Heart and Brain, to reſtore Spirits, provoke Sweating; and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently very ſoveraign againſt malignant and peſtilent diſeaſes, becauſe it drives the infection of this venom from the center of the parts, where it lurketh to the circumference, and makes the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170969:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſpots to appear. All which may be true, if the Syrup be made according to due proceſs. But the Phyſitian is fruſtrated of theſe noble Effects, by the evil and wrong preparation which we have juſt now quoted; ſince nothing is left to the Syrup ſo prepared but an ungrateful bitterneſs, which proceeds from its material and groſs Salt, inſtead of that pleaſant quickneſs to the taſte it ought to have; and that ſubtile and delicate ſteem which is diſcerned by the Smell: which is properly a token, that this Syrup is not deprived of its volatile ſulphureous Salt, in which are placed all the vertues required and hoped from it. But the coction of this Syrup which cannot be performed without boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, carries away all that ſubtile vertue which occaſions it, not to anſwer the indications of the learned and experimented Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, and much leſs the hope of the Patient.</p>

They preſcribe to put in the one or the other, a judicious quantity of the external Rind of Limon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaying, whether it ſhall be done in cold or warmth; ſince, if they ſhould even have this foreſight, it would be to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for, if the Rind be put in warmth, the ſmell and volatile Spirit will immediately vaniſh away, and there ſhall remain but an odour and taſte of Turpentine; if in cold, the viſcoſity and clammineſs of the Syrup, loaded with the bitterneſs and extract of the Rind, ſhall not be able to receive, nor be capable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract that vertue which is pretended to be introduced in it, though very ſubtile of it ſelf.

                                 <p>I know there is none ſo little acquainted with Cinamon and the parts which adminiſter and contain its vertue, as alſo of other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatical Subſtances, but chiefly, that of Cloves; who doth not admire, and pitty this ridiculous and ſimple deſcription, of one of the nobleſt and moſt excellent Syrups which an Apothecary can prepare or keep his ſhop furniſhed with, and which all the Authors of it do deſtinate to the refreſhment and repairing of vital Spirits; to retrive the vital heat, and reſtore it to the Heart and Stomack, when driven away from it by ſome mortal cold;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170969:114"/>correcting alſo the ill breath of the Mouth, and the corruption of the Ventricle; to help digeſtion; and finally, to repair and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all the ſtrength of the body. I know, I ſay, that none never ſo little verſt in the Art of diſtilling, and extracting the aethereal ſubſtance of aromatical bodies, but particularly of Cinamon, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but have an averſion to ſo defective a preſcription, taken from a Diſpenſatory wherein ſo many grave Doctors have had a hand. All the vertues attributed to the Syrup of Cinamon are real and true, provided they be preſerved: But let us, I beſeech you, examine a little, with what fine and judicious precaution, the Authors of this preſcription have laboured to do it. They ordain to the Apothecary to boyl this Syrup in an earthen Pot exactly ſtopped; but conſider, that at the ſame time they preſcribe the ſtopping of the Veſſel, they would have the contained mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be boyled to a conſiſtency of Syrup, which cannot be done, but by the ſlow evaporation of the ſuperfluous liquor, or by its ebullition. If then the cover of the Pot hath an edge inlaid in the other, and ſo juſt and exactly fitted and ſhut up, and the Joynts ſo well luted, that nothing can tranſpire, the Artiſt or Apothecary ſhall never attain their end, which is to make a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup, according as they are preſcribed to do, ſince there will be a perpetual circulation of vapours from the bottom to the top; for what ſhall riſe from the bottom ſhall condenſe in the top of the cover, and thence fall back again, without any hopes to attain this way to the conſlency of a Syrup. There muſt then of neceſſity be ſome exſpiration, and even ſome ebullition, to conſume <abbr>lb</abbr> ij. ſs of ſuperfluous and ſuper-abounding liquor, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to give a body and conſiſtency to the Syrup. Now, would it not be a very great damage, and a conſiderable loſs, to let eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate and fly away in the Air <abbr>lb</abbr> ij. ſs. and more of a ſpirituous Water, of a very fragrant ſmell, very pleaſant taſte &amp; great efficacy. Yet theſe erroneous proceſſes and operations can only be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the help of Chymiſtry, ſince it is by her means we come to know, that Cinamon poſſeſſes in it ſelf, as all other aromatical bodies, a volatile ſulphureous Salt, ſo ſubtile, that the leaſt heat is capable to extract it and drive it away, if the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt doth not obſerve to ſtop with a great exactneſs, as he ought to do, not only the joynts of the Limbeck, but alſo of the noſe
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170969:115"/>wherein it joyns with the mouth of the Recipient, otherwiſe he ſhall loſe the moſt ſubtile and efficacious part of the ſaline Spirit of the Cinamon, accompanyed with that of the Malmſey, or whatſoever other Wine, the Artiſt doth make uſe of.</p>
                                 <p>Let us now proſecute to demonſtrate the extreme impertinency of this deſcription, by adding ℥ ij. of good Roſe-water upon ℥ x. of Cinamon, and <hi>lib.</hi> ij. of good Water of Cinamon, and <hi>lib.</hi> i. of Malmſey; and that which is yet more ridiculous, is, that the odour of this Water muſt vaniſh away with the ſubtile and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile part of the other. But it may be objected to this, That Sugar, which is a vegetable Salt, of a median nature between fix and volatile, ſhall be capable to fix and detain by it ſelf the volatile Salt of Cinamon; and ſo without reaſon do we inveigh againſt this Syrup, ſince this uniting mean is capable to preſerve the vertue of what enters in its compoſition. But though, this argument ſeem to be full of ſtrength, and even hath very much in it, we will nevertheleſs illuſtrate the truth without deſtroying the ſame, and that by the following diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. We do then diſtinguiſh between warm Sugar, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Sugar cold; for we confeſs indeed, that Sugar reduced to a ſubtle Powder, is capable to receive in it ſelf the aethereal Oyls of aromatical Subſtances, and alſo all other diſtilled Oyls, that it is even capable to unite them, and mix them indiviſibly with the Spirits and Waters, which is none of the leaſt ſecrets of Chymiſtry: But we abſolutely deny this union and mixture to be poſſible in warmth, even in the leaſt heat; and ſo much leſs by conſequent in that heat which is requiſite to the boyling of a Syrup, where it is neceſſary to evaporate above <hi>lib.</hi> ij. of ſuperfluous liquor. The intention we had to elucidate truth more and more, hath obliged us to deduce this matter ſo much to the full, and to ſhow evidently the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity of the intervention of Chymiſtry, which is the fitteſt Miſtreſs to teach how truly to operate in all the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Pharmacy.</p>

Continue thus until the Cinamon in the bottom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears dry; the ceaſe, and put by the Cinamon. Reiterate your operation with like quantity of freſh Cinamon, pouring upon it the Water firſt extracted, and diſtil as you did at firſt, reiterate it until the third time; and having ended, put your Water in a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle well ſtopt with waxed Cork, and cover it with a wet Bladder, leſt that it ſhould loſe and exhale away the beſt and ſubtileſt part of its vertue. Then take afterwards all the remaining Cinamon, put it in a Cucurbite, and pour upon <abbr>lb</abbr> iiij. of common Water; cover it with its Head; lute, and diſtil in Sand, and draw off <abbr>lb</abbr> i. ſs. that in caſe any volatile and virtual ſubſtance ſhould remain in the Cinamon, it may be drawn off again without loſs: This laſt Water ſhall ſerve in the Laboratory for the laſt lotion of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries and Precipitates, as alſo for the extraction of ſome Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.

It is a treaſure and preſent remedy in all weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: but chiefly, in long and difficult travels of Women, where their ſtrength is exhauſted, and they conſequently deprived of the beſt part of their Spirits and natural heat: and as there is no Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable that poſſeſſes more of Spirits then Cinamon, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, being animated with the Spirits of Wine, all that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is found concentrated in this Syrup by an admirable harmony, ſo, that is capable to produce all the effects we have attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto it. The <hi>Doſis</hi> is from one half to one and two ſpoonfuls.

                                 <p>We will end this Diſcourſe concerning Syrups, by the notes and obſervations we ſhall make upon compounded Syrups: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that as they are deſtinated to ſeveral ends, ſo are they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded with different matters, which do require a different manner and way of preparation. But before we enter into our matter, we muſt ſay ſomething that may affect the mind of the Reader, and open his underſtanding, whereby we may alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct thoſe that apply themſelves to the ſtudy of the nobleſt Pharmacy. And to begin, I will ſay: that Natural Phyloſophers, which are the ſoundeſt Judges of things, do aſſure us, that all whatſoever receives, doth receive according to its proper way of receiving <hi>Secundum modum recipientis;</hi> and not according to the way of the thing received, <hi>Secundum modum recepti,</hi> which is to introduce ſome new quality in the Recipient. If this Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Axiom is true in it ſelf, as no body of ſound judgement can doubt of it; it will chiefly appear to be ſo, and we will make it evident herein. Becauſe no Apothecary can make a compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Syrup, without extracting before hand the vertue and tinctures of the ſeveral ingredients which are to be received into the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, which is that which commonly Chymiſts do call their <hi>Menſtruum:</hi> Now of whatſoever quality or nature that <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi> be, it cannot take upon it ſelf, nor be impregnated with the Tincture or Eſſence of any Vegetable, Animal, or Mineral what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170969:116"/>but according to its own way or capacity of receiving, which cannot be otherwiſe diſpoſed then by the weight of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is nothing elſe but the capacity, and ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the moſt ſubtile matter of the extracted body, whereof the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> is impregnated; and when it is thus filled and ſatiated within, either cold or warm, all the power of Art can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make it to take up more; becauſe, as we have ſaid, he is loaden according to the weight of Nature, which cannot be tranſgreſſed, unleſs with a deſign to loſe all, or fruſtrate the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: for,
<q>
                                       <l>Eſt modus in rebus, ſunt certi deni que fines:</l>
                                       <l>Quos ultra citraque nequit conſiſtere rectum.</l>
                                    </q>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>For example. Take ℥ iv. of ordinary Salt, diſſolve them in ℥ viij. of common Water warm, and you ſhall ſee the Water to take up but ℥ iij. of the Salt, and leave behind the fourth, and though you never boyl or agitate ſo much the Water with the Salt, yet it ſhall not be capable to receive more; becauſe if it appears diſſolved in the heat, it ſinks nevertheleſs afterwards to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and coagulates when the water is grown cold. But to prove more evidently, that the Water is naturally and ſufficiently loaded; take a competent quantity of this Water ſo impregnated with Salt, that an Egge may ſwim in it, whereby you may imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately know, whether the Water is loaded according to the weight of Nature; for if it hath as much as it can be capable to receive, the Egge will ſwim above the Water; but, if it be not ſufficiently loaden or impregnated, the Egge will immediarely ſink to the bottom; becauſe the Water is not ſufficiently filled with the diſſolved body of the Salt to hinder the ſinking of that of the Egge. Another proof and experiment thereof, is made in the boyling of Hydromel or Mead; for, when the Water is not yet ſufficiently loaded with the ſmall bodies of Honey, the Egge will never ſwim above the Water; but to the contrary, will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſink to the bottom: but, when by reiterated experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, you are come to bring the Egge to ſwim above Water, it is then a true ſign of the ſufficient boyling of the Mead, and that the Water is as much impregnated with Honey as it can
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170969:117"/>bear, to have a pleaſant and vinous drink thereof, after due fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; whereas if it be more loaded, the drink will prove clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and cleaving to the lips, by reaſon of the over-abundance of Honey; and if it be not enough, then it is defective, and wants its ſufficiency of the body of Honey, to give it the taſte and ſtrength it ought to have; becauſe the Spirits of Honey, which cauſe its goodneſs, are in too ſmall a quantity to cauſe due fermentation. We ſay the ſame thing of Spirit of Wine, <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> plain and diſtilled Vinegar, corroſive Spirits of Salt, Nitre, Vitriol, or Copparis, all Strong-waters generally, Liquors or Menſtrua's, which are capable to extract or diſſolve any Body, Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral. For example, put Coral groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly powdered in a Matraſs, and pour upon diſtilled Vinegar, by degrees, to the height of three or four fingers, you ſhall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately perceive its action, and hear a certain noiſe in its ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which cauſes the diſſolution of the body of Coral; but when this ebullition and noiſe is ceaſed, filtrate the liquor which ſwims above, and put it upon new Coral in Powder, and you ſhall perceive no more action or noiſe; which evidently proves that liquor to be ſatiated with the body received, and uncapable to admit any more; Take alſo Water, <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> or Spirit of Wine, and put upon Saffron, until it be exhaled to a very high colour; then take afterwards new Saffron, and pour this tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture upon it, and you ſhall perceive, that this will extract no more, and that your Saffron will remain of the ſame colour as when you did put it in at firſt.</p>
                                 <p>It happens ſo to all Vegetable Bodies entring in the preparation of compounded Syrups, as Herbs, Flowers, Fruits, Seeds and Roots. All theſe bodies have a Salt in themſelves, which though of a different nature, doth notwithſtanding load or impregnate of its ſubſtance more or leſs Clammy, the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary doth uſe, according to the Diſpenſatory from whence he hath his direction, proportionally to the weight of Nature; and when this <hi>Menſtruum</hi> is once impregnated, with the vertue or eſſence of any of theſe things, to the concurrence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the weight of Nature, it is impoſſible it ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract to it ſelf the tincture or, vertue of other bodies added to it afterwards, without ſome deperdition and loſs: for the nature
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170969:117"/>of theſe bodies will be either fixt or volatile; if fixt, the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi> is already loaded with ſome thing of like nature, and ſo this body ſhall never communicate its vertue to the decoction of the Syrup already ſufficiently loaded: but, if the vertue of this body be volatile, it will needleſly evaporate during the ebullition of the ſuperfluous liquor in the concocting of the Syrup.</p>
                                 <p>All what we have ſaid here above, may ſufficiently ſhow the neceſſity of delivering our promiſed notes upon the compounded Syrups, and the examples of the dividing the matters which enter into the compoſition of theſe Syrups, to extract their eſſence and vertue, according to the ſeveral nature which is in them, whether it reſides in the fixed part, or be found in the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile.</p>
                                 <p>We ſhall then make uſe of the example of ſix kinds of Syrups, having ſix ſeveral uſes, and conſequently, compounded of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſubſtances, and extracted with different <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> to demonſtrate the better the truth of all the poſſible means. Theſe Syrups are; firſt, a Stomachal one, which is the compounded Syrup of Wormwood. Secondly, an aperitive Syrup, which is the acetous, or compounded Syrup of Vinegar. The third is, an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterical Syrup, or good for the Mother, which is the compounded Syrup of Mugwort. The fourth, a cholagogick and hepatical Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup, which is the compounded Syrup of Endive or Chicory, with Rhubarb. The fifth is, a thoracical or pectoral Syrup, dedicated to the diſeaſes of the Breſt, which is that of Hyſop. The ſixth is, a purgative and phlegmagogical Syrup, which is the Syrup of Carthamie, or Baſtard Saffron. We ſhall firſt deliver them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ancient diſpenſations, and then ſhall make our notes thereupon of their imperfection: after which ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our preſcpition for preparing after the modern way, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically and without defects.</p>

By which it appears, that theſe men only fail in their operations, for want of having been initiated in the Myſteries of Chymiſtry, whereby they ſhould have been taught to reaſon with more judgement, and work with more circumſpection.

To what purpoſe again this duplicated and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated colature? Since it ſhall never be able to purifie the deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that it is abſolutely neceſſary to clarifie it with whites of Eggs, to prepare therewith a Syrup, which may be pleaſant
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170969:120"/>to the ſight and taſte. The ſecond ever is, that they will have the aromatical ſubſtances to be put in only towards the latter end of the decoction; leſt, ſay they, their vertue which doth conſiſt in very ſubtile parts ſhould vapour away; not conſidering, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the decoction might have received ſome vertue from the aromatical ſubſtances, no ebullition of them being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, yet this vertue muſt vaniſh away, when this ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction ſhall be boyled with Sugar, and ſo their precaution is both unjudicious and ignorant: But as for the third, is it, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the aromatical ſubſtances are to be heeded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170969:120"/>of the Plants which do compoſe it; which by their bitter taſte give a ſufficient teſtimony of the eſſential Nitro-tartarous Salt abounding in them, which is both aperitive and diuretick; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the aperitive Roots poſſeſs in themſelves a Salt which is analogous to that of Plants; but, that which doth conſtitute its chief vertue is the Rhubarb, which is the root of one of the kinds of <hi>Lapathum,</hi> containing in it ſelf a volatile, ſubtile and very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious Salt, a Balſamick and Conſervative Sulphur of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Stomack: which is proved by its taſte and tingent colour, which not only communicates it ſelf to Excrements and Urin when well conditionated, but even carries the penetration of its tincture to the Eyes and the Nails. It would then be a very great damage to loſe the vertues of this wonderful root, or to neglect directions, how to extract them right, and preſerve them carefully. This Syrup is uſed againſt Obſtructions, Jaundiſe, Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical Diſeaſes, Cachexy and impurities in the Entrails, debility of the Ventricle, Epilepſie or Falling-ſickneſs in general; but principally, againſt that of Children, and finally it is imployed, to expel by Stools and Urins, all what can be vitiated in us; and all this is true enough, becauſe this Syrup muſt be filled with the eſſential Salt of Plants, and the volatile Salt of Roots accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with the Balſamick Sulphur of Rhubarb, which do correct all the defects of the Spleen and Stomack, the two parts which cauſe all the diſorders which this Syrup can appeaſe and reſettle as is fitting.</p>

                                 <p>This is the common way of making this Syrup: to which vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Apothecaries have thought fit to joyn ſome other Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to make it the better, which nevertheleſs, do not much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the other: for, though they imagine in them to have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better mended the matter, they go nevertheleſs to work but blindly, and grope without being able to find out the true way, becauſe they are not guided by the light of Chymiſtry. They ſay then, that the Barley muſt be macerated 24 hours with the Roots and dry Subſtances of this Compoſition, in ſuch a quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as is required, and that all the reſt may be together boyled to the conſumption of the one half.

But yet, had they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed before to clarifie this decoction, to deveſt her from the groſs body, which the collature cannot take away; they ſhould have ſhown ſome ſpark of judgment, which yet would be defective in this, that it might indeed thus extract better; but would not preſerve the volatile part of the Rhubarb, nor the odour of the Spikenard, becauſe before you can make a true Syrup, <abbr>lb</abbr> x. or <abbr>lb</abbr> xi. of

For, if we take the pains to examine throughly the ingredients wherewith it is compounded, we find nothing in it but an <hi>abyſſus</hi> of miſtakes and <hi>Chaos</hi> of Errors; and what I do yet find worſt, is, that Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry here is at a <hi>non-plus,</hi> not knowing where to have her recourſe and repair the defects of this practice: For, the Roots and Herbs yield already from themſelves a decoction ſufficiently courſe; the Fruits render it clammy and viſcous, but the Gum and Seeds ſhall render it altogether muſcilaginous; So, that it will ever be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to take a Syrup therewith; and, if any doth advance himſelf ſo much, as to boaſt that he may effect it—</p>

But this is not all; but, beſides this, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the moſt important loſs of volatile and ſulphureous Salts, Herbs, Roots, and Seeds, which fly away, and evaporate by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction. Let us then ſay, how the buſineſs may be mended, and let the following Syrup, be a rule and model for all other purging compounded Syrups.</p>

This indeed ſeems true, if you have reſpect to ſome peculiar kind of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170969:125"/>Roots, but not generally to all: for, ſome do poſſeſs the vertue of the whole Plant, ſo, that theſe are ſome Plants whereof the ſole Root is of uſe for Phyſical Preparations, becauſe ſearchers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have found by experience, that the Salt Sulphur and Mercury of theſe Plants had its principal heat in the Root, as their taſtle and odour may witneſs. And as ſome Roots are wooddy, nervous and knotty; ſo, there are others that are thin, ſoft, and ſpongi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; ſome are mucilaginous and full of jelly, as others are lacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and full of marrow: ſome are bitter, ſome ſweet, ſome ſharp and pleaſant to the taſte; as to the contrary, other ſharp, biting, and even corroſive; finally, ſome are of a pleaſant ſmell, others very unpleaſant, and even offending the Brain and Breſt, whereas the firſt do recreate and ſtrengthen it.</p>

                                 <p>They that ſhall deſire to ſeparate the Spirit from the Water, muſt make the rectification of it in <hi>B.

                                 <p>The firſt Spirit being aſcended, encreaſe the fire, and extract the ſpirituous water, which ſhall follow until it comes out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taſte or ſmell; throw away the remainder, becauſe 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable: and preſerve this water to mix ſome of its Spirit with it, or diſſolve the extract of the Root from whence it hath been extracted.

                                 <p>Moſt commonly there ſwims over the firſt diſtillation made <hi>per veſicam,</hi> an Aetherial Oyl which muſt be ſeparated by the Flannel, or Funnel, and carefully preſerved; for it is a very noble Eſſence, to make thereof a potable and diſſoluble Balſom in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, or a Preſervative Balſom in time of Plague. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it often happens, that this Oyl ſinks in the bottom of the Veſſel which hath received the water, becauſe the violence of the ebullition hath cauſed it to take along with it ſelf a portion of the fixt Salt of the Root; it muſt alſo be ſeparated with care, for it will not be inferiour in vertue to that which ſwims above, though it be nevertheleſs ſomething leſs ſubtile, and of leſs activity.</p>
                                 <p>But let us return to examine that which did remain in the Veſſel after diſtillation, containing in it ſelf the fixed Root of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170969:126"/>the Root and a portion of its Sulphur, which never parts from it, by reaſon of the ſtrict union and tye they have together; this truth is juſtified by the colour of the remaining liquor and its taſte: which would argue a great imprudence, and defect of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and judgement in the Artiſt, if by his negligency and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance he ſhould ſuffer a deperdition of that ſubſtance, which nature and his own ſenſes make not only appear by the outward judgment, but is alſo really good in its ſelf. Therefore muſt the Chymical Apothecary acknowledge, that this vertue cannot be concentrated but in that which he calls an Extract, which is to be made after the following method.</p>
                                 <p>Expreſs and ſtrain the whole, then clarifie with whites of Eggs, and let run through the Flannel or the Hypocras Bagge, and evaporate this liquor by a very gentle heat to the conſiſtency of an extract, which may be called between the conſiſtency of a maſs of Pills, and a liquid Electuary, that it may be given either in <hi>Bolus</hi> or Pills, when the Phyſitian ſhall preſcribe; or, that it may be ſooner diſſolved in ſome appropriated liquor, according to the intention for which it is uſed. Now before we deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the <hi>Doſis</hi> of this Extract, we muſt ſay, by the way, that all Extracts which are made in this manner, are friendly to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and do gently looſen the Belly, without interrupting the oeconomy of digeſtion, and making any ſuperfluous or hurtful col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquation. And let this ſerve as a general Note for all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts which are made out of ſulphurous and volatile Vegetables, after the Spirit, Oyl, and Water is drawn from them. The <hi>doſis</hi> of this extract, as of others of the ſame nature, is from <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ſs. to ℥ ſs. either alone or diſſolved, and mixt in its own water, or ſome other analogous liquor, and that to open gently the Patients Belly, without any fear of thoſe perturbations which do uſe to happen, by reaſon of the irritation and violence of ordinary Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives.</p>
                                 <p>And as nothing is to be loſt of what poſſeſſes ſome vertue, you muſt dry the Cake remaining after expreſſion, and calcine it in an Earthen Veſſel, or Crucible not glazed, until the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be reduced to gray Aſhes, whereof make a Lye with diſtilled Rain-water, which filtrate and evaporate till it be dry, to extract the Salt of the Roots; which afterwards put in a Crucible, and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170969:126"/>heat, it glowing-red upon a fire of Coals without melting; then diſſolve it in the laſt water extracted; filtrate and evaporate it to a skim, and let it ſhoot into Cryſtals in the cold, then draw the Salt which ſhall come pure and clean: and ſo continue until there be no more Cryſtallization. You may mix a portion of this Salt in its own water, to render it leſs ſuſceptible of alceration, you may alſo put another part in the extract, and it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the ſtomachal and cathartical vertue thereof. The reſt you ſhall keep, to the end, that if you deſire to re-unite all the fixt and volatile vertues of the Root of <hi>Angelica</hi> in one body to make a <hi>Clyſſus</hi> thereof (which is that ſubſtance properly which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it ſelf, as in a <hi>compendium,</hi> all the vertues of a Mixt, the parts whereof have been ſevered and depurated) you may joyn again the rectified Spirit and aecherial Oyl, by the uniting <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> which is the fixt Salt, without which it is impoſſible to make any union of the Oyl and Spirit, becauſe they are of a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and will ſwim ever the one on the top of the other: but, when you have alkalized the ſubtle and rectified Spirit with the proper Alkali of the Plant, then ſhall you inſeparably joyn the Oyl, whereof is produced a marvellous ſubſtance: but, as for the <hi>Clyſſus,</hi> there is no need of ſo much refining, mix only one part of fixt purified Salt, with 2 p. of diſtilled Oyl, and 3 p. of the very ſubtile Spirit, and digeſt together in the vapour of a Bath in a circulatory Veſſel, until all the ſubſtance be indiſſolubly joyned and united together; which for the moſt part is performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the time of a Philoſophical Moneth, which is 40 dayes, or that which we commonly call the ſpace of ſix weeks. This remedy thus prepared, may be given inſtead of the Spirit, Oyl, Extract and Salt. Having all the Eſſential faculties of theſe four togther.

Thoſe that have addicted themſelves to this operation, have much laboured and took great pains, before they could meet with a ſubſtance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of colour and ſmell, and that ſhould not turn to corruption in time. For ſome years, white Wax and Marrow, were two ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects uſed to this purpoſe; as alſo the fat or ſuet of Kid and of Pork, well prepared and waſhed: but this laſted very little, theſe ſubſtances becoming ranck, of ill odour, and yellow.

Then put all what remains in a white Earthen diſh, and waſh with boyling water, until the whole maſs becomes white and inodorous, and this will ſerve to make the Body of all unctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Balſoms, which contracts no ill quality, and will eaſily be impregnated, with the odour and vertue of odoriferous and aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Oyls. But, becauſe the eye as well as the ſmell muſt be pleaſed, the green colour is imparted to the Balſoms of Plants, with the juyces of ſom inodoriferous Herb, wherein the Body of the Balſoms is put to boyl, which you intend to have thus colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The Balſoms of Oyls of Roots and aromatical Subſtances are coloured with yellow Earth, when they come near that colour

M.</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of a Syrup or boyled Honey and ſo ſhall he obtain the extract of Nutmegg impregnated with the beſt of its corporeal ſubſtance; and a Spirit poſſeſſed with its Oyl Spirit, and volatile Salt; if you pleaſe, you may keep ſome part of its extraction; for this ſhall be as a <hi>medium</hi> between the Extract, and Spirit, which hath been drawn off it, and may be made uſe of to the ſame purpoſes, becauſe it poſſeſſes the ſame vertue and efficacy. The vertue of the Extract, Spirit and Tincture, refreſhes and delights the Stomack, Brain, and Womb, corrects the ill ſmell of the breath, diſſipates wind, helps digeſtion, ſtrengthens the <hi>Embrio</hi> in the Womb, is good againſt Swoundings and beating of the Heart, opens and diſſipates Obſtructions of the Spleen, ſtops Lasks and Vomitting. And as I am a witneſs of the vulnerary vertue of Nutmegg; I think my ſelf obliged for advancing publick good, to relate here, what I have ſeen done in <hi>Germany,</hi> in the perſon of a Captain of Horſe, filled all over the Body with wounds both of ſhot and Sword, and who nevertheleſs, had never felt any touch of Ague in all the time his wounds were about to be cured, not even when the ſuppuration was working. This will ſeem, without doubt, very ſtrange and Paradoxical: But, when I have told you, that this Gentleman did ever wear about him Nutmegg,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170969:128"/>and aſſoon as he felt himſelf hurt, did eat a whole one; your admiration will ceaſe, ſince the Balſamical vertue of Nutmegg, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in its Oyl and volatile Salt, being driven by the heat of the Stomack in all the parts of the Body, did correct the malignant and dangerous ſeroſity, which is the occaſional cauſe of pains, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations, and by conſequence, Feavers, and finally, Death, in the greateſt part of thoſe which are hurt in ſome principal part of the body. Chirurgions then muſt not ſo lightly fear vulnerary Potions, neither to make uſe of this Aromat in the Broths of their Patients, by reaſon of its too great pretended heat: to the contrary, the more expert and skilful they are, and guided by good judgement, they have their recourſe to the ſame, as to a very ſafe refuge, which will never fail them; but chiefly, if they uſe externally as wel as internally, the tincture extracted after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by us related here above. Let it not be objected to me, that I bring a perſonal example; ſince the ſame hath happened to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his friends, though they were of a different temper, as they ſpeak, and had been very ill and ſick in the cure of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other wounds, becauſe they made no uſe then of the ſaid Nutmegg.</p>
                                 <p>I hope, this digreſſion will not have proved unpleaſant, ſince it is uſeful both to the general and private good; but, we will make appear, that Chymiſtry doth not content it ſelf with the colour of unctuous Balſoms, whereof we have made mention even now, ſince it hath found the ſecret to colour the body of Balſoms, with the Magiſtery of the ſame Plants wherewith the Balſom is to be made; and it is thus performed.</p>
                                 <p>℞ Rhue or Marjoram, or any other balſamick and odoriferous Plant, as much as you will, when they are yet in the vigour of their green, boyl it in water ſufficiently impregnated with the Oyl of Tartar, made <hi>per deliquium,</hi> or plain Tartar diſſolved; ſtrain the coction, and pour upon it diſſolution of Rock-Allom, made in diſtilled Rain-water, and the matter will precipitate it ſelf toward the bottom, in the form of a green Pap: Separate the ſwiming liquor by filtration, then waſh the filtrated matter with common water at firſt, and with the odoriferous diſtilled water of the Plant it ſelf towards the end, until you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived it of all ſaline taſte, which it may have received from
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170969:129"/>the Salt of Tartar and Allom: Evaporate afterwards with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle heat this Magiſtery, until it hath acquired the conſiſtency of a very thick Pap, with which you ſhall tinge the white and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorous Body of the Nutmegg, which you ſhall gently dry in the Air, to preferve for the making of your Balſom; or, if you add to it preſently, the diſtilled Oyl of the Plant, then will the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom be perfect, and keep its odour, and its colour as long as you can wiſh. But note, that you muſt not altogether dry the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Flowers or Herbs, before you colour the body of the Balſom; otherwiſe, there would be no union, nor perfect mixtion made, and by conſequence, no colouring.</p>
                                 <p>The ſame operation we have deſcribed may be made upon Flower of Roſes, Pionie, red Poppy, Iris, Scarlet-grain or Kermes, to make Magiſteries thereof, which will be uſeful to colour the Balſoms of Flowers without any forain mixture.</p>
                                 <p>Before we end this diſcourſe of Balſoms, we will after the learned <hi>Sennertus,</hi> teach the manner how to prepare Balſoms, as to the internal part in another way then with Sugar; which, though they be not ſo pleaſant, yet will have no leſs, if not more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and will contain, as in a ſmall volume, the efficacy of the Mixt whereof they receive their compoſition. Take then ℥ i. of the extract of the Plant, of its Root, Flower, or Seed; to which add <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ij. of ſelect Manna, mix them together upon a gentle heat; and when the mixture is cooled, add <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. ſs. of the diſtilled Oyl of the Mixt, and ſo ſhall you have a Balſom which may be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in <hi>Bolus,</hi> or mixt in Broths, or given in other liquors appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the diſeaſe.</p>

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170969:129"/>which is familiar with us, many good remedies to adorn and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his ſhop with, where Phyſitians may have their recourſe when they need it, for the good of their Patients.</p>
                                 <p>We begin by the chuſing of the time wherein this Root is to be taken out of the ground, that it may be abundantly furniſhed, of what we ſeek in it, which is a volatile ſpirituous and ſulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Salt, manifeſting it ſelf by taſte and odour. This Root then is to be pulled out of the ground in the beginning of the Spring, when it begins to bud and peep out of the Earth; for, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay longer, this vertue which is concentrated in the Root, and is the ſoul of Vegetation, explicates it ſelf and ſhoots out, to declare the viſible Character of its inviſible Idea, given unto it by the Creator of Nature, and ſo doth exhauſt it ſelf from its own ſeminal vertue, to ſupply the beauty of perfect Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                                 <p>Having got a good quantity of Root thus qualified, and being yet tender and juicie, ſo that it may be cut in long ſlices or round pieces; waſh it well, then ſlit the moſt likely and moſt tender Roots in long bits, of the length of the fore-finger and bigneſs of the ſmall; and cut the other in round pieces of the bigneſs of a Crown; then put them in a Glaſs Cucurbite in Sand with a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of clean water, cover it with a Head Limbeck, and fit to the ſame a Receiver, and exactly lute the Joynts thereof; then give it a gradual fire, &amp; diſtil it encreaſing ſtill the heat, till what in the Veſſel begins to boyl, that the Roots may be well boyled. By this Operation many things are performed at once; for, when the Root is ſo boyled, as to be grown ſoft to the hand, you may with the remaining decoction in the Cucurbite boyl Sugar to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of a Sugar Roſat, therein to dip the long ſlices, after they have yeelded their ſuperfluous water upon a Sive turned upſide down; and ſo ſhall you have a liquid Preſerve of <hi>Campana,</hi> which will keep long: if you boyl further the Sugar, and put the Root once again in it, and dry it in a Stove, you ſhall have a dry and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Preſerve for ſuch as will uſe it in travelling. Moreover, you may beat the round pieces, after they are ſtrained, and the liquor expreſſed in a Marble Mortar, and extract the pulp thereof, which preſerve with Sugar boyled in Lozenges, and it will be a very good kind of Preſerve alſo for its peculiar uſes; but, which
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170969:130"/>alſo will ſerve as a body, to receive other remedies for the Spleen and Breſt, and ſo you may frame Opiats and Electuaries, which will be very excellent.</p>
                                 <p>But we keep that which is beſt for the end, which is the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Water and volatile ſulphurous Salt, extracted by diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, during the boyling of the Root, and which ſhould have been loſt, had this decoction been made in an open Kettle or Veſſel upon an open fire: and would be a great loſs, and argue a defect of judgement, knowledge, and experience in the Artiſt: for, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled Water hath the ſame taſte and ſmell as the Root, and by conſequence, doth poſſeſs the beſt part of her vertue, becauſe it is filled with a very excellent and ſubtile Salt volatile, which aſcends into the Head of the Limbeck under the form of Snow, and cleaves to the ſides thereof, when heat cauſes the Water to penetrate into the very center of the Root, and when this Salt is freed from the mucilagineous ſubſtance of its body, it is ſublimated by the fires activity into the Limbecks Head; it is true, that it doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main long there, being immediately diſſolved by the aqueous aſcending vapours, and carryed along with them into the Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and this Salt doth communicate to the Water its taſte, odour, and efficacy. Let thoſe which deny credit to my diſcourſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the work as I have juſt now related, and watch exactly when they ſhall obſerve the Limbecks Head to be full of white va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, and ſome ſubſtance cleave to the ſides of it; let them be provided with another equal Limbeck; then taking away the firſt, ſubſtitute a ſecond in its room; and then will they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves convicted by their own ſenſes of the truth I have aſſerted; for, the Spirit of this Salt, ſhall fill their Noſe and Brain immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately with the genuine ſmell of the <hi>Enula Campana;</hi> and, if they apply a little of the ſublimated Salt upon the tongue, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, the very Plant not to have even had ſo ſubtile, penetrative, and efficacious a taſte; ſo that it would be an irreparable da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and a groſs ignorance, to loſe the principal and more vertual part of the ſubject which is wrought upon.</p>
                                 <p>Thoſe that will make the Extract of the <hi>Enula,</hi> muſt dry it a little more then half; then reduce it to a groſs Powder, and place it in a double Veſſel of the Blind Head with ſubtile white Wine, to the heigh of four fingers, which they ſhall digeſt and extract in
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170969:130"/>heat of aſhes, until the Wine be impregnated of the taſte, ſmell, and yellowiſh colour of the Root; then ſhall they draw again what is impregnated, and put new and freſh Wine until it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts no more; then muſt be made an expreſſion of the whole, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> put in a Cucurbite in <hi>B. M.</hi> with the requiſite precautions, to draw the Spirit and ſpirituous Water, until the remaining ſubſtance hath neither ſmell nor taſte left; clarifie after this what is left in the bottom of the Veſſel, and evaporate in an Earthen diſh in aſhes until it comes to the conſiſtence of an Extract, which ſhall poſſeſs in it ſelf all the vertue of what is fixed in this Root: which is not deſpicable, becauſe it opens the Belly and ſtrengthens the Stomack. The <hi>doſis</hi> is from <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. to ℥ ſs. and this extract is very efficacious to diſſolve and evacuate the fixt, glutinous and tartateous ſubſtances lurking in the Ventricle, Spleen, or Breſt: but chiefly, it conduces to the cure of Periodical Aſthma's, provided you mix ſome Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Antimony, or Volatile Sal of Karabe or yellow Amber, which will not fail to ſtrengthen the Ventricle, and appeaſe the motions and meteorical ſwellings of the Spleen, which for the moſt part do oppreſs the Diaphragma, one of the chief Inſtruments and Organs of Reſpiration, and which cauſes the oppreſſion of the Stomack, and ſhortneſs of breath.</p>
                                 <p>This Extract ſhall be a rule whereby to prepare thoſe of Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Roots, Pellitory of Spain, Carline-thiſtle, and chiefly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayerval, which is a Root coming from <hi>Peru,</hi> and one of the moſt Soverain remedies againſt Poyſon: but chiefly, in all Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential and Malignant Diſeaſes, as Camp and Purpled Feavers, Meaſels and Small Pox, becauſe it rids potently away the venom of it, and expels dangerous ſeroſities by Sweat and Urin. It is marvellous alſo in corruptions of the Stomack, and chiefly Worms. There are even ſome, which believe, that its uſe is capable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate the charm and poyſon of Philters, or amorous Potions. The <hi>Doſis</hi> of the Root in Powder is from ℈ ſs. to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. in Wine or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, or ſudorifick Waters, as that of <hi>Regina Prati, Carduus Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictus,</hi> or Mead Sweet, and Saſſefras. But the extract of it made by exact operation, and the Spirit drawn by diſtillation, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compare much better then the material Body of the Root, and their <hi>Doſis</hi> leſs by half. I could not refrain from ſpeaking ſomething in my way concerning this noble Root, knowing that
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170969:131"/>it is yet concealed to moſt of the French Apothecaries: and I make no queſtion, but that thoſe which by the order of Phyſitians ſhall make uſe of it, will find thoſe effects to anſwer the vertues I have attributed unto the ſame.</p>

                                 <p>AFter I have ſpoken of Odoriferous and Aromatical Roots, which are of a high taſte and full of ſenſible volatile Salt: we muſt ſpeak afterwards of Mucilagineous and almoſt Inſipid Roots; but, though they ſeem ſo to be taſteleſs, yet do they in ſufficient abundance partake of much vertue; provided, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt may free and untye them of the clammineſs and viſcoſity of their ſubſtance, to bring to light the Salt and Spirit in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the quickneſs and efficacy whereof are as it were impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned and fettered by the ligaments of this clammy and agglutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſubſtance, which hinders them to produce within us, thoſe noble effects which they are capable to produce, and which they conceal in their own center. But to perform this, there is no way but by Chymical operation, which diſcovers the hidden ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and man feſts the myſtery contained in each Mixt. We will begin with the preparation of the Great <hi>Conſolida,</hi> or Comfrey, which though viſcous and inſipid, produces notwithſtanding very rare effects outwardly and inwardly applyed; for it is of a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous vertue, to diſſolve all contuſions, ſtrengthen the ſinewous parts of the Joynts in all ſort of luxations. But it is much more efficacious in plaiſters, with Powder of the Stone, called <hi>Oſtoeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> both to hinder the accidents of fractures, as to generate the <hi>callus,</hi> neceſſary in the re-uniting of broken Bones. And, if this Root doth produce ſo remarkable effects for the external parts; it is not leſs wonderful to ſtop the ſpitting of Bloud, whether oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the rupture of ſome Vein, or proceeding from the eroſion of the Veſſels, which ordinarily happens in the Breſt or Throat: Moreover, the uſe of it doth continue the healing of the ſeveral kinds of Hernia's: Provided at the ſame time the part affected be kept tyed up with a good fillet, and every third day a Plaiſter or <hi>Cataplaſma</hi> of the ſame Root be applyed, with <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eus martis</hi> aſtringent, and dulcified Earth of Vitriol. This we have only mentioned, to let the Reader know, that this Root
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170969:131"/>is full of a wonderful vertue, if ſo be the Chymical Apothecary is capable to digeſt and extract it according to Art, ſeparating the hurtful heterogeneities, which hinder this ſo conſiderable hidden vertue from being reduced into act, to bring to light the myſtery of Nature, which every individual ſubſtance deeply hides in its center.

Then let the Furnaces cool again; take away the Veſſels,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170969:132"/>and run through new and clean Linnen the matter which you muſt ſtrongly expreſs and ſtrain. This expreſſed ſubſtance thus red and coloured, put in a vaporous Bath, to make a ſecond digeſtion thereof, and a more exact purification; for, the liquor will much better clarifie, and the feces and remaining impurities, will make a ſediment in the bottom of the Veſſel, which muſt be ſeparated by a gentle inclination, until the liquor be clear, red, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, ſo that no more impurities appear in the bottom. Put then this liquor ſo depurated in a Cucurbite, in the vaporous Bath or <hi>B.

                                 <p>This method of Preparation muſt be exactly followed, to make the extract or bloud of Satyrion Roots: except only, that no other ingredient is to be added in the compoſition of it, but, that of Bread and Wine, with <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. of very good Ambergrice, to each pound of the matter which is to be digeſted. The <hi>doſis</hi> is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſame with the former extract, both good to ſtrengthen the Womb; and render fruitful and apt for generation.

Take the Roſin from the Cucurbite and put it in an Earthen Platter, and waſh it three times with pure Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to take away the tang of the Spirit of Wine, which every one is not equally pleaſed with; but you muſt waſh it the fourth time with Roſe-water and Cinamon mixt together; then dry it gently in embers, and keep it for your uſe.

You muſt then make uſe of yolk of Eggs to dilute and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve purging Roſens, that they may the better incorporate and allay either with the Ptiſan or Broth wherein they are exhibited to the Patient: for, the reaſon of fearing theſe kinds of remedies never proceeded but from accidental cauſes; they, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their operation, being in no wiſe dangerous, unleſs, when they are ill diſſolved and united with the aqueous liquor: But, we thought very neceſſary to give this Advertiſement in the way, by reaſon of thoſe ill accidents which dayly do hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen thereby.</p>

                                 <head>Of the Roots uſed for the Extraction of Fecula's.</head>
                                 <p>WE cannot enough admire the long practiſed abuſe, even by the wiſeſt and moſt experimented Phyſitians, concerning Fecula's; and I wonder, that thoſe which ſo often have advowed, confeſſed and taught, that all the vertue of Subſtances reſides only in their Salts, but chiefly, of Vegetables: I wonder, I ſay, that theſe Chymical Phyſitians, ſhould have made uſe of Fecula's, and attributed unto them the vertue of opening, diſſolving, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating even into the utmoſt digeſtions. And to prove the true ground of my wonder, you muſt know, that the Fecula's are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the farinaceous and inſipid part of the Root; and, to ſpeak properly, as the white Starch of it: Now there is no body ſcarſe, but knows, that a ſmall quantity of the ſame will coagulate a great deal of water, and ſo conſequently, muſt have the ſame operation in the Stomack, when the Fecula's are introduced in it, and the natural heat begins to act upon, as the leaſt heat doth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on white Starch. But to diſcover the better this miſtake, I will deliver the moſt exact and artificial way of preparing Fecula's, to ſhow even to the meaneſt apprehenſion, that I have aſſerted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt truth; and that I condemn this common abuſe, grounded only upon reaſon and good experience.</p>
                              </div>

                                 <head>The manner of preparing Fecula's.</head>
                                 <p>FEcula's are commonly made out of five kinds of Roots chiefly, which are <hi>Arum,</hi> or Coockow-pint, <hi>Iris,</hi> Piony, Briony, and great Dragons. But it will ſuffice, to give an example of any of the five, which will be as a model for the reſt, and all thoſe that are of a like nature. Firſt of all, the time wherein the Root muſt be gathered, is to be attended, when you will make the Fecula, and that is, when the Plant begins only to put out the leaſt bud, otherwiſe, no good could be done upon it. ℞ then Briony Root at ſuch a time, and waſh it exactly; then ſcrape the out-ſide of the Root, and ſo get the ſubſtance by ſcraping very cleanly; then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs hard the ſame, and let ſettle in the bottom of the Veſſel a kind of white feculency, until the juyce be all cleared, which
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170969:135"/>draw off ſoftly by pouring down: and as you will find a mucilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and yellowiſh ſubſtance, above the whitiſh Flower which ſettles in the bottom; you muſt pour upon it a little of luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm clear water, to make the ſeparation thereof, by a ſlow and circulary agitation; that being ended, you muſt put this farina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous Subſtance or white Starch in a Marble Mortar, and agitate the ſame with clear water, until it be as white as Milk, then percolate this white Water through a new Tamy ſomewhat cloſe, that the groſſer part may remain within; then cover the Platter, and ſuffer the Fecula to make a ſettlement, re-iterating this agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with new Water three or four times, after which, you muſt ſeparate the Water by a ſoft and ſlow inclination; then cover the Platter with a white Paper, bored through with many ſmall holes of a Needle; then expoſe it to the Sun, until the Fecula be dry, which will be as white as any Starch, if you proceed in the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with exactneſs and cleanlineſs.</p>
                                 <p>This is the manner of artificially preparing your Fecula's: but, it were to be wiſht, that they were endowed with the rare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues attributed unto them; for, there is no judicious man, never ſo little initiated in the myſteries of Chymiſtry, who doth not conceive, that this earthly and feculent portion, which by its own weight is ſevered from the juyce, is rather an excrement of the Root, than a ſubſtance containing its vertue; for, it is not with the family of Vegetables as with that of Minerals and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals: Since Vegetables have only their vertue contained in a ſaline and volatile ſubſtance, whereas the Metals and Minerals are fixt in a manner; and, that in this fixt ſubſtance and their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and cloſe center, is placed their chief vertue. Now this ſaline ſubſtance is, without doubt, in the juyce of the Plant; ſince it is a proper quality of Salts to diſſolve themſelves in Water, and if any part of it ſhould remain amongſt the Fecula's, the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which are to be uſed with ſingle pure Water to purifie them, carry away, without any doubt, the remainder of their vertue; ſo, that there is nothing left but a ſubtile Earth, of a mere white Starch or Flower: It would then be much better, to uſe thoſe Roots, whereof the Fecula's are extracted, after they have been dryed, either whole, or cut in round ſlices; for, then may the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt be confident, that their ſaline and mucilagineous vertue is
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170969:136"/>concentrated in their own body by exſiccation, and, that nothing but the aqueous phlegmatick and unneceſſary ſubſtance is vapoured away. I dare moreover affirm, that what is commonly thrown away after the expreſſion of theſe Roots, is without compare, worth much more, then the feculas from them extracted It is much better to ſtrain the juyce and depurate it, and then evaporate it in <hi>B. M.</hi> to a conſiſtency of inſpiſſated juyce or extract, to make uſe thereof in caſe of need, ſince it will be endowed with the vertue of the Root, and will not fail to produce the hoped for effects: with this I ſhall put an end to the exemplification of Roots, to come to the other parts of Plants, according to their Order.</p>

                              <p>ALthough we have amply and generally ſpoken of Leaves of Vegetables, when we did handle their preparation, and their difference, in the beginning of this Chapter of Vegetables: yet, there remain many things to add, as much concerning the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation of their ſingle Waters, as of their Spirits and Oyls; for, as concerning their extraction and reduction into Salt, we have ſpoken enough of it heretofore; yet will we ſay ſomething more particularly of it.</p>
                              <p>We have ſufficiently inſtructed the Artiſt how to proceed with odoriferous Plants; thoſe that are acid and juycie, thoſe we have called Anti-ſcorbutick, which are juycy and biting, by reaſon of the volatile Salt contained in them, to draw out ſeveral kinds of preparation: but, we muſt teach here, the way to diſtil Plants for the general uſe of the Chymical Apothecary, according to the <hi>claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> unto which they belong.</p>
                              <p>To this end, the Artiſt ſhall have recourſe to the Figure hereby annexed, for the erecting a Furnace fit for his uſe in the diſtilling of inodorous Plants, and not acid, ſuch as are ladies-mantle, or Lions-foot, Burrage, Bugloſs, <hi>Cardnus Benedictus,</hi> Eye-bright,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170969:136"/>Fumitory, Lettuce, Mercury, Nightſhade, Cowſlip, Purſlain, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delion or Taraxacon, Varvin, and all other Plants of this <hi>claſſis,</hi> or that are kin to it. To the end this Veſſel may be uſed with ſome advantage, we muſt briefly explain the way how to do it, and the reaſons why it is to be preferred to others. Thoſe that have made uſe hitherto, and make yet dayly, of the Leaden Bell, and its Veſſel under, to diſtil the Waters of Plants and Flowers, could never hinder their Waters to contract an ill odour or burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſmell, which is called <hi>Empyreuma,</hi> becauſe they were impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and over-haſty in ruling their fire, and that they neglected to make uſe of ſome interpoſed <hi>Medium's,</hi> to hinder the too violent action of the fire, upon ſo ill fixt a matter as is in Vegetables: but, when Chymiſts came to diſcover this defect, they made it their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to prevent it. And to this purpoſe have they invented the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of this Furnace by us repreſented, and likewiſe of the diſtillatory Veſſel it contains, whereof follows the deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
                              <p>Firſt of all, build a round Furnace of 2 ½ foot diameter, and as much in height, wherein is left room for an Aſh-hole, and a <hi>focus</hi> for the coals to burn in; a foot higher then the grate of the <hi>focus,</hi> appropriate a Cauldron or Kettle made with Plates of eight inches deep, and of each ſide an inch leſs in breadth than the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter of the Furnace, that it may receive heat from all parts; this Cauldron or Kettle muſt alſo have a brim three inches broad, to hold faſt upon the ſides of the Furnace, and ſupported under by two croſs barrs of Iron. This brim muſt have eight holes in it, of one inch diameter, equally diſtant one from the other, which may be made to open and ſhut, with the ſame mettle as the Cauldron is, that theſe holes may be inſtead of Regiſters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to increaſe and ſuppreſs the fire. This Veſſel muſt have in the bottom two inches thick of Sand or Aſhes, to place thereupon the ſecond Cauldron, which muſt be of tinned Copper, 1½ inches leſs of each ſide than that of Iron which is deſtinated to receive it, and of five ½ inches hight; this is the Veſſel which muſt receive the Plant, Fruit or Flower which is to be diſtilled; or any other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, provided, it be not acid. This ſecond Veſſel is to be covered with its Head Limbeck, which muſt be capacious and riſing in the way of an Arch-roof with two Channels or Noſes, by which
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170969:137"/>the Water is drawn off as it condenſes in it; the remaining proportions may better be conceived by the Figure hereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed; but we muſt, after this, ſpeak of its uſefulneſs.</p>
                              <p>The chief end of the Artiſt in the conſtruction of this Furnace, and its diſtillatory Veſſel, hath without queſtion been to hinder the Empyreumatical ſmell, which is ordinarily contracted by the too near action of the fire upon the Veſſel containing the Plant, which is to be diſtilled: but, that cannot happen here for theſe following reaſons; Firſt, That the fire doth not immediately act upon the Veſſel containing the diſtillable ſubject, ſince it meets the bottom of the firſt Cauldron which offers the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; after this, the Sand or Aſhes make the ſecond, becauſe either of theſe two ſubſtances breaks the action of that devouring agent, and ſo the bottom of the Copper Veſſel receives only a temperate heat, and yet ſufficient to cauſe all the moiſture of the matter to be diſtilled in the Limbeck Head to aſcend, and there to be converted into Water, which is received in appropriated Recipients, and fitted for that purpoſe: Secondly, the Artiſt is not tyed to ſo great a care, nor ſo tedious an attendance: for, when he hath once put his diſtillation in a way, he may fill the <hi>focus</hi> with fewel or coals, without fear of any evil accident, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he takes care to ſtop exactly the doors of the <hi>Focus</hi> and Aſh-hole, and to leave no tranſpiration of Air to his Regiſter, or at leaſt ſo little, that it may ſimply be capable to feed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the fire in its degree, when the two Noſes of the Limbeck do drop in an orderly way, and without intermiſſion: for then is he aſſured that he need not heed the governing of the fire ſix, eight, or ten hours.</p>
                              <p>But that which is yet more advantagious and conſiderable, is, that the Waters thus diſtilled, have all the requiſite vertue in themſelves, which doth conſiſt in the eſſential Salt, or the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt of the Leaf or Plant whole with its Flower: but, you are to obſerve, that the matter to be diſtilled muſt be turned and ſtirred every four hours, if it be ſolid, raiſing ſoftly the Limbecks Head by the ſtring faſtned to its pully for greater facility. And when the Plant ſhall be wholly dryed, it will be found void of ſmell, dry, and eaſie to be crumbled; in ſuch a wiſe, that it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be reduced to Powder with the fingers end, without any kind
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170969:137"/>of burning at all; but contrariwiſe it preſerves a green colour, more or leſs brown, or blackiſh, according as the Plant was juycie.</p>
                              <p>This Veſſel doth not only ſerve towards the diſtillation of Herbs, but is uſeful alſo, to that of their Juyces; provided, they have been depurated in <hi>B. M.</hi> before they be put in the Still-Body, to avoid that the herbaceous odour, proceeding from the feces of the Plants, may not be communicated to their water: ſo ſhall you have a very good water, and the inſpiſſated juyce or Extract improperly called of the Plant. It conduces moreover, to the diſtillation of fruits, as to make the water of green Walnuts, Apples, Melons, Cowcumbers, and other like Fruits. With it may alſo be diſtilled Milk, Sperm of Frogs, and Cow-dung; whereof is made the Water called <hi>Mille Florum;</hi> finally herein, better then in any other Veſſel, may be diſtilled the Flowers of Nenuphar, red Poppy, Elder, Beans, and Honey-ſuckle: and to end in a word, it is a Veſſel which ought not to be wanting in a Chymical Laboratory, or the ſhop of an Apothecary curious of diſtillation.</p>
                              <p>Theſe Plants diſtilled in this manner, may eaſily be calcined, becauſe they are very dry, and then their Salt be extracted, to joyn with the Water of the Plant; and ſo not only be made more full of vertue and efficacy, but alſo, fit to be better and longer preſerved, without any alteration: which is the Apothecaries ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, the ſatisfaction of the Phyſitian, and the benefit of the Patient.</p>
                              <p>We have yet to ſpeak here of odoriferous Plants, which are Mercurial and Sulphureous, and which attain not to the true peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of their vertue; but, when the outward heat of the Sun, and their internal <hi>Archeus,</hi> hath concocted and digeſted rheir ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moiſture, which was a hinderance to their perfection. This kind of Plant nevertheleſs, is, that which furniſhes us with the largeſt and faireſt harveſt to provide the Shops of Apothecaries, and beſtow their time with more advantage, and greater pleaſure. The Plants of this <hi>Claſſis</hi> are, Wormwood, Sothernwood, male and female Aniſe, Dill, Chervile, Coriander, Fennel, Hyſop, Marjerom, Feverfew, Balm, Penny-royal, Parſley, Rhue, Sabine, <hi>Scordium,</hi> or Water-Germander Tanſie, and all other odorife ous
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170969:138"/>Plants which have ſome analogy or correſpondency with thoſe of this <hi>claſſis.</hi> The right time of gathering theſe Plants to enjoy their vertue, is, when they are fully blown, and the Seed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be framed in their ears, or heads: for it is the right time in which the Root is wholly exhauſted, and that Nature doth aim at the concentring and uniting in the Seed, the vertue yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated and diſperſed in the ſtalk, leaf, and flowers, and in this embryonated Seed. But the Artiſt muſt neceſſarily prevent the cementration, otherwiſe, there would be little hopes to extract the vertue of theſe Plants, by help of diſtillation by Water as it is done in the ordinary way of diſtilling Spirits. The reaſon is, becauſe, whatſoever is of a ſaline and volatile nature, is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner digeſted, concocted and fixed by the union of this ſpiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance into an Oyl-fat, clammy, and viſcous, which doth not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily communicate it ſelf to water, unleſs it be by diſuniting its parts and bringing them to fermentation, if I may ſo ſpeak: but it is unfit to labour in vain, ſince we can take theſe Plants in the nick of time that nature hath not yet brought that Vegetable to the height of its natural predeſtination, which is the perfection of the Seed, the ſpring of the perpetuation, and multiplication of beeings.</p>
                              <p>When you ſhall have any of theſe Plants gathered in the morning, a little after the riſing of the Sun, in the ſtate we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated above; cut it very ſmall with Cizzars, and put it in a Copper body filled ½ foot, neer the brim, pour Water upon it to the ſame height, and apply the Moors-head, or Still; lute the Joynts with Paper fillets paſted with Pap made of Flower and Water, then apply the fire to it, and leave the door of the Furnace and Regiſters open, until the drops begin to fall in the Recipient, and that you may not without burning your hand, graſp the Pipe which is between the Moores-head and the Still-body; then cloſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the Door and Regiſters, that the matter may not aſcend in a body into the Moores-head, by too violent an ebullition: but, that the vapours may only be raiſed and carryed to the Pipe (or Worm) which runs through the Fat wherein is the cold Water, which condenſes them in a Liquor mixt with Water, Spirit, and an aetherial and ſubtile Oyl, as is evidently to be ſeen in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient where the ſpirituos Water bears up the Oyl ſwiming over.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170969:138"/>The fire muſt be maintained in the ſame degree, until the Water iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing forth, be without odor and taſteleſs. After which, open the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and take away the matter contained in the ſame, which ſtrain, and ſqueeze the Herb; to put to dry and burn for the extraction of the Salt. But you muſt clatifie the decoction, &amp; evaporate to a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency of extract, which ſhall contain what is moſt fixt in the Plant: for, that which came out by diſtillation is of a volatile nature. You muſt let the Recipient, which contains the firſt part of what hath been extracted by diſtillation, be at reſt, that the oleaginous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance may in time ſeparate from the ſpirituous and aqueous, and gather above it; and this done, you muſt ſeparate the Oyl and Water by the help of a Cotton, which will draw it to it ſelf, and cauſe it to run into the Vial, which ſhall be tyed to the upper part of the Neck of the Recipient, as it will appear more clearly in the annexed Plate, in the figure adjoyning to the Furnace and its Veſſel: and when the Cotton ſhall draw no more, by reaſon of the ſinking of the Oyl; you muſt cauſe it to aſcend, by pouring ſoftly more Water of the ſame Plant, whereof the Oyl is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and ſo continue till all the Oyl be ſeparated from the Water. Having wrought upon a good Vegetable, and got good ſtore of ſpirituous Water, you may rectifie it, to poſſeſs the Spirit by it ſelf, which will go forth firſt of all, and ſo continue your diſtillation, till the Water comes without any ſmell, and then keep it for uſe,</p>
                              <p>This is the right method and way of Anatomizing the Plants of this laſt <hi>claſſis,</hi> to extract their vertue, and all what may conduce in them to the uſe of Phyſick: It is alſo the true method whereby you may attain to the intimate knowledge of Plants: for, as they abound either in Oyl, volatile, or fixt Salt, in Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Spirit, the indication of their uſe for fixt or volatile mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, <hi>i. e.</hi> where appear either Obſtructions or Colliquations, are to be taken: and I am confident, that Phyſitians will receive much more ſatisfaction this way, then if they ſingly argue and rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt and ſecond qualities; ſo vainly hitherto attributed unto them by modern and ancients Authors: whence it appears, that Chymiſtry is the true Key to open Natural Bodies, whereby to diſcover their vertues, &amp; apply them next to the uſes unto which by the Creator's Providence they have been deſtinated for the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170969:139"/>cure and eaſing of ſuch maladies unto whom the infirmity of our nature hath ſubjected us.</p>
                              <p>It is not a fit place for us to enlarge here upon the vertues of the Spirits, Oyls or Eſſences, Extracts or Salts, of theſe kindes of Plants, becauſe we intend only to ſhew a general way of Operation, without coming to particulars: but he that deſires to be better informed this way, let him conſult the learned and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Diſpenſatory, of the experienced <hi>Schroderus,</hi> Ordinary Phyſitian of the City of <hi>Franck fort</hi> on the <hi>Main:</hi> where, in a very compleat Abbreviate, he will find an ingenuous deſcription of the vertues of Plants, and all other natural products, handled; with an order and method worthy of ſo eminent an Author, to whom the Common-weal of Chymical Phyſick and Pharmacy hath no leſs obligation then the Galenick.</p>
                              <p>We will put an end to this Section, by a deſcription of the manner to be uſed in extracting the Oyl of Plants, their volatile Salt, their Spirit and fixed Salt, without any addition; which is performed by a Retort in open fire in a cloſe Reverberatory Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace: taking now for an example, the Plant vulgarly called To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco. Were we in a time where this Plant ſhould be leſs known, it would concern us to ſay ſomewhat of its original; but, there are ſo few that can be ignorant, that it is brought from the <hi>Indies,</hi> that it would turn to importunity to the Reader, to ſpeak any thing more thereof. Let us only mention in our way ſome of the names, becauſe Authors who ſpeak of it, have variouſly denominated the ſame. The <hi>Indians</hi> call it <hi>Petum,</hi> or <hi>Petechenune,</hi> whence the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar name <hi>Petun</hi> amongſt the <hi>French;</hi> and becauſe <hi>Jean Nicot,</hi> Ambaſſadour for the Crown of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> was the firſt who did ſend Seeds to the Queen, it was called the <hi>Queens-weed, (Herbe a la Reyn,)</hi> and <hi>Nicotian.</hi> Others call it the Holy-weed, by reaſon of its wonderful effects. And though this Plant be now cultivated in <hi>France, England, Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> and doth proſper there very well; yet, that which comes directly from the <hi>Indies,</hi> dryed and prepared there, is much to be preferred before that which grows in our Clime: for, the Sun's heat is too weak with us, to digeſt the moiſture contained in the ſame, and to prepare in it that volatile Salt and balſamick Sulphur, which does conſtitute the chief vertues of ſuch remedies as are drawn out of it. Not, but
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170969:139"/>that new and freſh gathered Tobacco, ſuch as grows in our parts, may ſerve to make Salves, Plaiſters, Syrups, Honey, and the plain Balſom, ſo as it is deſcribed in modern Diſpenſatories, as alſo many other common remedies, mentioned in Authors, who have left upon record the praiſes of this wonderful Plant. But, as we will anatomize this Plant without any addition, and give to underſtand, what are the beſt inward qualities of it: we think it fitteſt, to take well qualified Tobacco, ſuch as that which is brought from the Plantation of <hi>Virginia</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-India's.</hi> And I cannot but declare my wonder, that Phyſitians and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions have not continued more to practiſe upon this Plant, and make uſe of it, as much inwardly as outwardly, ſince it produces effects, which are above the expectation of thoſe which can dextrouſly apply the remedies it doth afford: but, that it may no longer lay buryed in oblivion, you muſt diſtil it after this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner.</p>
                              <p>℞ <abbr>lb</abbr> iij. or iiij. of <hi>Virginia</hi> Tobacco, neither ſo phiſticated nor corrupted; ſhred it groſly, and put it in a Glaſs Retort, which place in a Reverberatory Furnace, upon the cover of an Earthen pot turned upſide down, and kept up upon two Iron-bars, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a handful of Aſhes or Sand upon the ſaid Cover, to hinder the breaking of the Glaſs by the contiguity of the Earthen cover, whoſe encompaſſing is to the Retort inſtead of a Lute, and a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> interpoſed to break the violence of the fires action: cover the Furnace, and fit your Recipient to the neck of the Retort, lute the Joynts thereof, with a good ſalted Lute, and let it dry gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; then give a gradual fire, and encreaſe it by little and little, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Recipient begins to be filled with clouds and vapours, at which time keep the fire in an equal temper, until the Glaſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be freed from fumes; then give it the laſt and extreme degree of fire, which is, that of flame, that the matter may cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and no volatile, ſaline, or oleaginous ſubſtance may remain, and when the Recipient grows clear of it ſelf, and that, though the fire doth continue its action, no vapour nor liquor comes out of the Retort, ceaſe your operation: All being grown cold, open the Veſſels, and pour what you find in the Recipient in a Glaſs Bottle, that the Spirit and and Oyl may ſeparate one from the other; after this, filtrate the Spirit with Paper, and the Oyl
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170969:140"/>ſhall remain in the Funnel with the Paper, which you muſt break with a little hole in the bottom, and ſo make the Oyl drop in a Vial, then rectifie the Spirit by ſeparating the Phlegm.</p>
                              <p>The Oyl may be kept without rectification for outward uſes: but, if you intend it for any internal uſe, you muſt rectifie it in a Retort in Sand or Aſhes; and to proceed more artificially, mix your Oyl with the remaining matter left in your Veſſel after the firſt diſtillation, until all be reduced to a maſs or lump, whereof you may make Pellets of a competent bigneſs to be put in a new clean Retort: which afterwards placing in a Sand Furnace, draw off your Oyl by a ſecond diſtillation, which will yield the ſame: very pure and ſubtile; which then may be inwardly uſed for ſuch purpoſes as we ſhall mention here-under.</p>
                              <p>This done, put all what remained from the firſt and ſecond diſtillation, in an Earthen Pot not glazed, or in a Crucible, to be calcined with a circular fire, until it be reduced to whitiſh or grayiſh Aſhes, which you muſt put to digeſt in a Matraſs in Aſhes, with a ſufficient quantity of Phlegm, which came out in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Spirit, to diſſolve therewith the Salt contained in theſe Aſhes; filtrate this firſt ſolution, and pour new liquor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Aſhes: and thus continue until the Water comes our taſteleſs, and inſipid, as it was firſt put in: then put together all the filtrations, and cauſe them to evaporate in an Earthen Platter, to a skim in a boyling Bath, and ſo place it in a cold Cellar to ſhoot into Cryſtals, or dry it throughly in the ſame vapour, working it gently with a ſmall woodden Spatula, and, when it is throughly dry, keep it for uſe in a well ſtopt Vial.</p>
                              <p>We ſhall not labour here to make a deſcription of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vertues of Tobacco: for, there are ſo many modern Authors that have treated thereof, according to the rules of ordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, that it would be ſuperfluous; I am only obliged to ſay, that I wonder how theſe Doctors, who know Tobacco only by the rind, and ſuperficially by his firſt and ſecond qualities, do ſtretch the paſſages which they find in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> to bring them to their own ſenſe; and make theſe two great Genius's of Phyſick to ſpeak for and againſt Tobacco, without ever having the ſight or knowledge of it, neither by its ſhape nor effects.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170969:140"/>Let us do otherwiſe, and ſhow, that Chymical Phyſitians are not only contented with the ſuperficies of things; but to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that they open them, to penetrate to their very center, and diſcover what good vertue they do contain, and appropriate it afterwards to external and internal maladies, to which they found by re-iterated experiences, noted with a ſolid judgement, that they did conduce.</p>
                              <p>The Spirit of Tobacco is ſo full of volatile Salt, that it muſt inſinuate thereby its vertue; it being the property of this Salt to deterge, attenuate and diſſolve whatſoever is againſt Nature, of whatſoever quality, and in what part ſoever contained: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Spirit may ſucceſsfully be uſed in the Aſthma and other oppreſſions of the Breſt, and the parts of it, proceeding moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly from glutinous and tartarous matters, of which this Spirit is the true ſpecifical diſſolvent; it is taken in Hydromel, white Wine, Broth, diſtilled Waters, or inciſive attenuating and pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral decoctions. The <hi>doſis</hi> is from iij. drops to xv. or xx. according to the age and ſtrength of the diſeaſed Patient. It works chiefly by Spitting, Urines, and Sweats, provokes even ſometimes Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, if it meets the Stomack of the Patient full of any muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagineous matter, becauſe this Spirit doth immediately act upon, elevates and ferments this hurtful lurking matter, and ſo <hi>quà data porta ruit:</hi> and if this Spirit is profitable, inwardly taken, its uſe is not leſs marvellous outwardly applyed; for it hath not its like, to mundifie ſinewous and cancerous Ulcers; above all, it doth rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well in the curing of Fiſtula's: It excels alſo above all other remedies, for freſh Wounds, and Contuſions, if it be mixt with Urine to waſh the parts, and afterward applyed warm upon the wounded part: and, for the laſt commendation of this Spirit, let us ſay, that <hi>Hartmannus,</hi> who was a very famous Phyſitian, as much renowned for the Theory as the Practical part, hath found no other remedy againſt the Critalline, which is the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and dangerous accident which can happen in the French diſeaſe, than the Spirit of Tobacco, which appeaſes, as it were, miraculouſly the extreme pains of this pernicious diſeaſe; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves powerfully that horrid venomous ſubſtance by which it is cauſed; and hinders, in a ſhort time, the evil and mortal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which ever do accompany it.</p>
                              <pb n="256" facs="tcp:170969:141"/>
                              <p>We have ſaid, that ſome part of the Oyl extracted from To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco by diſtillation, without rectifying, was to be kept, and that with much reaſon; becauſe, as this Oyl is not deſtinated to internal uſes, ſo is there no need to purifie it, with ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs: there is notwithſtanding another reaſon yet more preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and pertinent, which is, that rectification ſhould deprive this Oyl of the greateſt part of the volatile Salt which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and which is intimately joyned to its Sulphur. The greateſt external uſe of this Oyl, is to conſolidate new wounds, mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie and cure all evil Ulcers, and remove all accidents of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſions, becauſe it potently reſolves the extravaſſated bloud, and ſo doth hinder the heat and inflamation, which are ever fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of ſuppuration, which this extravaſſated bloud preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to be neceſſary: But it is never the intention of Nature, provided ſhe be in time aſſiſted by ſome balſamick remedy, ſuch as is the unrectified Oyl of Tobacco. It is alſo good for the Tooth-ach, and to diſſipate the chalky knots proceeding from the Gout, and Venery. Now, as it is both the volatile Salt and Oyl which joyntly produce theſe rate effects, it appears, that the unrectified is beſt for uſe; but, when you will make any internal uſe of this Oyl, you muſt in a manner correct its empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reumatical odour, which is very unpleaſant, and cauſes a riſing of the Stomack, and that cannot be performed but by rectification: It may be with a very happy ſucceſs employed againſt Suffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and fits of the Mother, againſt riſings, inflations, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritations of the Spleen, which do cauſe ſhort breath, by reaſon of the compreſſion of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> or Midriffe. It may alſo be exhibited againſt intermittent Feavors a little before the fit comes, in Water of ſmall Centaury and ground Pine: But I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adviſe, that the <hi>Clyſſus,</hi> whereof we ſhall ſhortly ſpeak, may be made uſe of for this purpoſe. As for the fits of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or other accidents thereof, you muſt uſe the Water of Penny-royal or Savin: and for the Spleen, Water of Saſſafras, or of juyce of Chervil. This Oyl is a very good antileptical remedy, provided, it be exhibited upon the fall of the Moon, in Camphir'd Theriacal Spirit, or in Volatile Spirit of Harts-horn, mixt of <hi>Lilly-Convallium</hi> and Balm. The <hi>doſis</hi> is from ij. drops to x. But you muſt note, that this Oyl muſt be made ſoluble
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170969:141"/>with Sugar powder'd before you mix it with aqueous liquors. We have only to ſay a word more of the fixed Salt of Tobacco, which poſſeſſes all its vertues: for, beſides that it is a mundifying skarrifier, very gentle in being applyed upon the driveling foul fleſh of Ulcers, and upon the callous ſides which hinder cicatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing; moreover, it gently moves the belly, if it be taken in Broths: it is alſo contrary to Worms, and all other corruptions generated in the bottom of the Stomack and the Entrails. It is alſo diureti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>doſis</hi> of the Salt is from iiij. to xv. or xx. grains, in decoctions or appropriated to the malady for which it ſhall be uſed.</p>
                              <p>But if the Artiſt will be at the trouble to make the <hi>clyſſus</hi> or compound out of 3 principles of the Plant, which are, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or Mercury, the Oyl or Sulphur, and the Salt mixt together, in ſuch a proportion as we have already taught, and puts them to digeſt together, uncil the inſeparable union of them be made, it will be without compare, a much more efficacious remedy, than any of the three principles ſeparated: but the <hi>doſis</hi> muſt be leſs by half proportion.</p>
                              <p>It may be, many will wonder, that I ſhould attribute ſo many, and ſo different vertues to the remedies extracted from Tobacco: but I doubt not, their wonder will ceaſe, when they ſhall take the pains, to make reflexion upon the different uſes which it is put to when the Plannis but newly gathered, or even in dryed leaves, by the common people, and moſt Chirurgions and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians: for, it is taken in ſmoke, in Maſticatory and Powder, to provoke Sneezing; whereof the effects are various, according to the various conſtitution of thoſe that uſe it: it inebriates ſome, it prevents drunkenneſs in others, cauſes vomiting, ſleeping, watching; to be ſhort, it ſeemeth, that this Plant (as in part it is true) hath ſome univerſal vertue, not to ſay divine: It is alſo to be conſidered, that there is ſome Chymical myſtery hidden under
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170969:142"/>the preparation of this leaf: for, though thoſe that prepare it, are not alwayes capable to give a reaſon of their proceeding, yet the Natural Philoſopher doth ever find much to Philoſophiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſince there is an obſervation to be made in chuſing the great middle leafs, rejecting the undermoſt, and cutting off all the ſhoots growing in the ſides of the ſtalk of the Plant, with the buds or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of the flowers, and cutting alſo the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>

There is alſo a nicety of conſtellation, whoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is very neceſſary to gather Tobacco, as well as to ſow it, if you intend to do ſomething with it more then the vulgar. The feed of Tobacco is dedicated to the ſigns of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> and of <hi>Mars.</hi> It is to be ſowed in the increaſe of the Moon in <hi>April,</hi> a little before the ſtepping of the Sun into the ſign of <hi>Aries;</hi> and that with great reaſon and prudence, becauſe it hath need of water and moderate heat in its beginning, which temper is ſcarſe found in any other ſeaſon of the year. It is gathered in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Moon in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when the Sun is in <hi>Leo,</hi> which is a conſtellation of dignity, ſtrength, and vertue; and in a ſeaſon, which may by its heat digeſt, as is required, the ſuperfluous moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Tobacco-leaves. But, that which deſerves yet bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our conſideration, is, that the leafs, buds, and growing flowers are not uſeleſs, but contrariwiſe, are as a Balm, and a preparing and preſerving Liquor, without which, the beſt conditioned leafs ſhould Loſe their vigour, ſtrength and vertue, either by their too quick exſiccation, or their ſudden corruption and putrefaction. The juyce of theſe parts ſo gathered and cut, is extracted after they have been well beaten in a ſtony or woodden Mortar; then let them be boyled with ſweet <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine, called decocted Wine, or with Malmſey, until all be well and curiouſly skimmed; after which, add ſome Salt, until the liquor hath acquired a taſte and faltiſhneſs neer unto that of the brine of the Sea, and at laſt throw into it Aniſe and Ginger very finely powder'd; and let this liquor reſt that it may depurate, and leave its ſeculency in the bottom of the Veſſel: this done, put it in Glaſſes very well
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170969:142"/>ſtopt; otherwiſe, all the vertue thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will fly away. With this liquor are the Tobacco-leaves to be ſeaſoned, when they are gathered: for, they uſe to be dipt one after another in a Bucket filled with this liquor, made ſomething more then luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm; for, were it boyling, the vertue thereof would fly into the air, by reaſon of its volatility: and beſides, the too violent heat would bake the leaf dipped in it, and make it uſeleſs. After this, lay theſe leaves thus prepared one on the top of the other, and cover them of all ſides, that they may lay to digeſt and ferment in a manner, until the liquor hath penetrated them in every part thereof, and that they begin to grow hot; then take one of theſe leaves, ſpread and expoſe it to the light, to ſee whether it hath begun to change colour or no, which colour muſt be ruddiſh or inclining towards a ruſty red, and if you find it ſo, uncover quickly your Tobacco, ſeparate the leafs; ſow or joyn them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and expoſe in a covered place, but open of all ſides, to the free paſſage of the air, ſo ordered, as that it may alwayes be ſhut up to the Sun and Rain, and, that ſo the leaves may tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately dry, until they be rolled up, or preſſed whole in Boxes well wrapt up in their own leaves, and ſome other covering about, to keep their ſubtile and volatile vertue from exhaling, which defect makes the Tobacco commonly call'd ſtale Tobacco, fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, unleſs it be reſtored to ſome proportion of its ſtrength and vertue, by the decoction of ſome parcel of good Tobacco made in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine; though ſome make uſe only of a little Beer, with a few Spices infuſed in it; and this is called, mended or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored Tobacco. I was the rather invited to deſcribe this Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to ſhow the neceſſity of the choice in Tobacco for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of good remedies, and to give the more occaſion to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the wonders ſhut up by the Creator's hand in this Plant, which is not applyed to that lawful uſe and purpoſe for which his infinite goodneſs hath produced it, namely, for the recovery and preſervation of health; but to the contrary, is abuſed and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exceſſes, which do offend his Divine Majeſty, wound and ruine man's health, and ſpoils families and civil ſociety.</p>

                                 <head>Of the Roſe, and of the ſeveral Chymical Preparations made by it.</head>
                                 <p>BEfore we begin to ſpeak in particular of the ſeveral Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which an Artiſt may make upon the Roſe, it is neceſſary we ſhould ſay ſomething of its differences, and the election which he is to make of them, to attain the propoſed end of his work:
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170969:143"/>for Roſes differ in vertue according to the more or leſs of their colour taſte and ſmell. For example, Province Roſes, or Red Roſes, are higher in colour then the reſt, of a more harſh and auſtere taſte, their ſubſtance more compact and leſs alterable then that of the other kinds, which argues a better proportioned mixture of their Salt and Sulphur, wherefore they are more cephalick and ſtomachal, as the Phyſitians upon this account uſe them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then others for Conſerves and making of Vinegar: but chiefly to extract the tincture after they are dryed, as we will teach hereafter. The pale kind of Roſes, which are called com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Roſes among the cultivated and garden kind, are of a more penetrating and ſubtile ſmell then the Province, abound more in juyce, and are ſooner faded and altered; in ſo much, that they can ſcarſe be dryed; they have alſo a more ſaline and bitter taſte which is a token of their purging and looſening or colliquative quality, as appears by their effects: wherefore they are moſt uſed for Diſtillations, Syrups, and Honeys, by reaſon of their abounding Mercury, of their Sulphur and Salt preponderated by their moiſture, which renders them capable of a quick fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and makes them eaſily to communicate their vertue, to ſuch ſubjects as do participate of any of the three principles abounding in them.</p>
                                 <p>There is a third kind of Roſes, which are called Damask Roſes, or Musk Roſes, of a very fragrant ſmell, and much leſs violently affecting the brain, than the Pale Roſes, not making ſo ſtrong a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquation, when they are uſed in purging, &amp; leſs prejudicial to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſubject to fits of the Mother; which is the reaſon they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to others, in the preparation of purging Syrups either ſingle or compounded: but as theſe Muſcat Roſes are not found every where, and for the moſt part, but in the hands of curious perſons which cultivate them, rather for the pleaſure of ſight and ſmell than Phyſical uſes; it will be lawful to make uſe in their place of the Wild Roſes, which being gathered in due ſeaſon, will eaſily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the effects of the other.</p>
                                 <p>The fourth kind of Roſes employed by Phyſitians, are, the white Roſe, only uſed for the Eyes and Women, for the reaſons alledged already: we will not here waſte frivolouſly our time in making a deſcription of all the ordinary operations which the Roſe yields
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170969:144"/>to Pharmacy: We ſhall only ſay, what we think to be neceſſary for inſtructing the Chymical Apothecary, to draw from this love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Flower the pureſt and beſt part of it, without loſs of any of its vertues. But before we come to particulars, we muſt briefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the time in which Roſes are to be gathered, that you may find in them the advantages which Nature hath placed. To this end, when the Artiſt intends to make any uſe of Roſes, he muſt cauſe them to be gathered a little after the break of day, when they have yet about themſelves ſome ſmall remains of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick moiſture, which the cool of the night did as it were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and concentrate, both without and within theſe Flowers: above all things, care muſt be taken, that it ſhould not be after a Rainy-day; but chiefly, when you intend them either for conſerve or drying: neither muſt they be gathered long after the riſing of the Sun; becauſe, that Planet ſeems greedily to ſuck the Balſom and Nectar of all the Flowers which are of an aetherial and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſubſtance: and amongſt all the reſt, Roſes are the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate; therefore thoſe that intend to work upon them, muſt take their time opportunely, as we ſaid juſt now.</p>

There may be added to each pound of Tincture, if the Phyſitian preſcribe it ſo, ℥ i. or ℥ ij. of Sugar; and in caſe it agrees with the Patients conſtitution. This Tincture is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent remedy to correct all defects of the Stomack, and chiefly, when out of order, by vomittings and lasks; when alſo digeſtion is depravated, and natural appetite to meat is defective; either by reaſon of ſome relaxation of the fibres of the Ventricle, or the dilatation of its Membranes: above all, it is a ſpecifical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, in the diſeaſe called <hi>Colera morbus,</hi> or voiding of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack both wayes, provided the Patient drink it by very great draughts: for, the Balſamical vertue of the Roſe, aſſiſted by the Stomachical acidity of Vitriol, Sulphur or Salt, doth admirably ſettle again all the agitations and tempeſts of choler, and turns them to a gentle and pleaſing calm: It is alſo a very pleaſing and uſeful drink in all hot Feavers, either continual or intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: for, for the moſt part, theſe Feavers do proceed of ſome corruption generated in the Stomack, which hath produced an alteration in the ferment of digeſtion, which never fails to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the malignity of the conceived Ideas in the food of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and continually carries this venom, and conveys it in the Veins and Arteries, which cauſes the differency of Spirits, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Feaver and its redoubled fits.

And, as we have ſaid heretofore, That the tincture of Roſes did ſettle again the Stomack and its functions in their duty; ſo muſt the ordinary drink be made thereof, which Patients troubled with that kind of Feaver are to take.</p>

                                 <head>The manner of Extracting the Water, Oyl, Spirit and Salt of Roſes.</head>
                                 <p>WE will not repeat here, the reaſon why we doe take the pale or common Roſes, nor the time fitteſt for ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering them, having already ſpoken thereof in the beginning of this Section. Let us only ſay, how the Chymical Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary is to proceed, in drawing the vertues contained in the ſame. And to begin:</p>
                                 <p>℞ <abbr>lb</abbr> viij. of pale Roſes, and pick them, ſeparating the leaves from their ſtalks, which nevertheleſs, muſt not be thrown away, as is the common practice: but, contrariwiſe, left with the Roſes becauſe, that yellow ſubſtance which is in the midſt of the Flower, contains a material Oyl, which in the diſtillation aſcends in the form of Butter ſwiming on the top of the water, drawing to its ſelf the ſubtile and aetherial Oyl of the leaves of the Roſe, and fixing it; ſo, that thus proceeding, the Artiſt will find the double or treble part more of Oyl than otherwiſe: put the Roſes in a Body, whereof the Head, and Pipe or Worm paſſing through the Fat of Water to cool the aſcending Spirits, be made of Tin, or at leaſt of Copper newly Tinned: becauſe otherwiſe, the Oyl would draw the taſte and greeniſh colour of the Copper, by reaſon of its volatile Salt very penetrating and very active. Pour upon the Roſes, which ought not by any means to be bruiſed, the fourth part of Rain-water, if it be poſſible, or of River water; then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil in the manner often already mentioned, Ceaſe not your fire until you perceive by the ſight, taſte and ſmell, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter iſſuing participates no more of Oyl, being inſipid and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſmell; and when you perceive it to be ſo, open the Body of your Still, and empty it in a Cask whereof the Lye hath been newly taken away, and begin your diſtillation with new Roſes, that you may not interrupt and loſe the heat of your Furnace; and continue this operation until you have a ſufficient ſtore of Oyl to do therewith, what we ſhall hereafter declare. And when you have gathered all your diſtilled Waters in a great large Glaſs Veſſel, let them reſt together, that the Oyl may gather on the top, and ſo be drawn with a Silver Spoon: or, to proceed yet better, ſtrain all your Waters through a Linnen, ſpread over a<note n="*" place="margin">Un Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee.</note> ſquare
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170969:145"/>Frame, and all the Oyl will remain upon the Linnen, which muſt be preſerved in a very well ſtopt Bottle, by reaſon of the ſubtility and activity of its parts. If you will preſerve your Water as it is, you may, for it is good; but, you may nevertheleſs, make it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and much more active, and efficacious, if you cohobate it twice over. <abbr>lb</abbr> viij. of Roſes bruiſed in a Marble Mortar. And, if you demand the reaſon why we have ſaid above, that they were to be left whole, and now we ſay, they ought to be bruiſed in a Mortar; the anſwer is, That in the firſt diſtillation, we had no further intention then to extract the Oyl, without caring much for the goodneſs of the Water; and, that as the Artiſt muſt know, the Oyl is confounded with the Salt and Spirit, by the mixture and contuſion made in the Mortar, which would hinder it to aſcend and be freed by the action of the fire in diſtilling, becauſe the Spirit and Salt do inviſibly keep it amongſt themſelves in the Water: upon which is grounded our preſcription to bruiſe the Roſes in the ſecond diſtillation, intended only for the meliora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Water, and communicating unto it a greater ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                                 <p>We return now to the remainder of our diſtillation left in the Cask; which muſt be ſtrained through a coorſe Linnen Strainer, and the Cake left muſt be dryed, and calcined, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, the Salt thereof in the manner above related when we ſpoke of the fixed Salt of Vegetables. But, as we will put the liquor come forth in the ſtraining to ferment with new Roſes; it might be asked, why we have ordered the diſtilled Roſes to be ſtrained before fermentation; and this queſtion, being not without good grounds, muſt be anſwered and ſatisfied with pertinent reaſons; by which it may appear, that we have not ſaid it without very good grounds, and an abſolute neceſſity: for, had the ſubſtance of the Roſes been fermented, the fixed Salt which is in them ſhould have been diſſolved by the action of fermenting, and ſo volatilized, that all this ſaline ſubſtance ſhould have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Spirit, whereas the firſt diſtillation did extend no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (neither was intended) then to extract the aetherial Oyl, and a portion of volatile Salt of the Flower. You muſt then mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately warm that which hath been ſtrained, and put it to ferment with xx. or xxx. <abbr>lb.</abbr> of new whole Roſes, with either Yeſt or Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170969:146"/>obſerving all the requiſites, and neceſſary precautions in this operation, which are ſufficiently delivered in the beginning of this Chapter, to which we ſend back our Artiſt; as alſo for what concerns diſtillation, and rectification of the Spirit to be extracted.</p>

                                 <head>The way of preparing the true Eſſence of Roſes.</head>
                                 <p>THe example we are now to give, is not one of the leaſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Chymiſtry, wherefore we will deliver it with all poſſible exactneſs, that the Artiſt may make uſe of it with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and advantage. To this end, take ℥ iiij. of Salt of Roſes, and put them in a ſmall Cucurbite, and pour upon <abbr>lb</abbr> ſs. of the beſt Spirit of Roſes: then apply a Head to your Cucurbite, and lute exactly the Joynts thereof, and draw off the Spirit in the ſlow heat of <hi>B. M.</hi> that it may become alkoholiſated, that is to ſay, well dephlegmed; for then nothing but the pure and meer aeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial ſubſtance will aſcend, and the Salt keep all the Phlegmatick part. But this ſubtiliating of the Spirit is not yet ſufficient; for, it is required beſides, that this Spirit be impregnated with the pureſt and ſubtileſt portion of the fixed Salt upon which it was diſtilled, and this is that Spirit which Chymiſts do call alkalizated, as if they ſhould ſay, a Spirit participating of the Salt <hi>Alkali</hi> of its Plant; a name given by the <hi>Arabians,</hi> to all kinds of Salts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from Vegetables or their parts, by the help of calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and elixiviation. Put then the Salt remaining after the alko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holized Spirit in a Crucible, and dry it by moderate degrees to the fire, until it grows red; and above all, take great care that it ſhould not melt, and when it is moderately cooled, put it in the Cucurbite, and the ſpirit being poured upon it, diſtil as at firſt; and ſo continue and re-iterate three times, drying the Salt, and diſtilling the Spirit, to acuate it, and furniſh it with a ſufficient portion of its own Salt, which will be an uniting mean to joyn and mix them indiviſibly together, and to frame thereof an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Eſſence, as much for its ſweetneſs and perfume as for its medicinal vertues, which do far tranſcend all other operations of Vegetables. Now the chief of all this myſtery, is, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaliſation of the Spirit; wherefore the Artiſt muſt have a very exact regard, to make it with all requiſite punctuality. To make
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:170969:146"/>the mixture of theſe two bodies with a requiſite proportion, you muſt put one part of the aetherial moſt pure and moſt ſubtile Oyl, and pour upon it three parts of the alkalized Spirit, and you ſhall ſee them inſtantly unite together in a wonderful manner; and ſo ſhall you have an Eſſence fit to be mixed to all kind of liquors, which infinitely recreates the ſenſes by its pleaſant ſmell. And if you joyn to it the Eſſence of good Ambergrice, and Limon Rind, it will prove a Cordial and Cephalick remedy, not to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allel'd by any other, as much for the excellency of its ſmell, as for the ſubtile &amp; efficacious vertues of the ingredients which compoſe the ſame, and are very penetrating, capable of raiſing up again the Spirits dulled and extenuated, by ſoporiferous and lethargick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which moſt commonly ſtrike to the Brain, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num its affections; as alſo it is of great vertue in all failings of the Spirits and paſſions of the Heart; whether this Eſſence be given in Broth, Wine, or Cordial Water, or even any drops be let down between the teeth if they be cloſed, and thruſted with a Feather or a little Cotton in the Noſtrils: The ordinary <hi>doſis</hi> of theſe Eſſences is from ij. to vi. drops viij. or x. in any of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Vehicles.</p>
                                 <p>In this very manner may be prepared all the Eſſences of ſuch Vegetables, as yield an aetherial Oyl, and may be fermented to extract the Spirit; whether thoſe Plants be odoriferous or no. For thoſe which we do not like for the ſmell, have notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their profitable uſes, and ſpecifical vertues, for ſome part or other of the humane body. But, as there are ſome ſubſtances extracted from Vegetables or ſome other bodies, which do yield notwithſtanding Oyls of very great vertue, but would afford much more, were they converted into Eſſences, as are Gums, Reſins, and yellow Amber; we will ſay here only in few words, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalized Spirit of Wine may be made uſe of to eſſencificate them, or the Spirit of ſome other Plant which may have a correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with the Diſeaſe or affected part. And this ſhall ſuffice for the Roſe. We come now to the Roſemary, which may be uſed in the ſame manner, and according to the ſame directions, and ſo have we no more to add here, but only the manner of preparing the Water, called of <hi>S. Elizabeth,</hi> or <hi>Iſabelle,</hi> Queen of <hi>Hungary,</hi> which is in truth a worthy noble remedy.</p>

You muſt diſtil the other part in <hi>B.

You muſt exactly ſtop the Bottle in which you put this Water, becauſe it is extraordinarily ſubtile. <hi>Zapata,</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> both Phyſitian and Chirurgion, doth attribute to the remedies extracted from Roſemary almoſt innumerable vertues, and that with much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for, this Plant is full of a volatile Salt and Sulphur, two of the chiefeſt agents of Nature: but chiefly, when their vertue is animated by the ſubtility of the Spirit of Wine, which doth in a moment penetrate from the center of the Stomack to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the Body, and doth inſpire a new vigour into all the functions of our life. All the vertues of this Balſamick Tincture Water and Extract, can ſcarſe be worthily enough deſcribed and magnified.

This is a remarkable effect of this remedy as to the internal vertue, which we owe to the faith of Hiſtory: But I muſt alſo relate here ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther external cure, to prove more and more the noble and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vertue of this Water, by what happened to a Serving-Maid in my own houſe; which by falling upon the hindg of a Door, had received a great bruiſe in the Fore-head; and having on a ſudden repercuted the tumor raiſed in the place, by binding hard upon it Linnen dipt in fair Water, with a piece of Gold put upon it, took away all outward ſign of any hurt; but, the accidents which followed a little after, made it ſufficiently appear, that there was bloud ſhed under the <hi>Pericranium:</hi> for ſhe ſoon after grew heavy and ſleepy, did ſtagger as Drunkards uſe to do, and ſpoke nothing but idly, without feeling, with all this, any ſharp pain, and leaving any outward token of her Diſeaſe, which occaſioned me to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a croſs-folded Linnen dipt in this Water of the Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> upon the place where ſhe had received the contuſion, and to make her take a good ſpoonful of it inwardly, which did put her in a ſlumber, or rather ſleep, for the ſpace of one hour; and when ſhe awoke again, ſhe ſaid, ſhe found her ſelf cured, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately walked and recovered her perfect Senſes: but, that by which her cure did much better appear to be true, was, that all her Fore-head, Noſe, and the parts about the Eyes, did appear of a colour as of Marbled Paper; becauſe, the bloud which had ſetled under the Skull or <hi>Pericranium,</hi> and did cauſe all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer accidents, had been digeſted, and as it were diſſolved, by the ſubtle and penetrating vertue of this admirable Water: ſo, that after this, ſhe needed no more but the application of a ſecond folded Linnen, which perfected the cure, without ever any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſince. I have yet many other Experiments and Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made of the noble Effects of this Water: but, it ſuffices to have ſpoken generally of the vertues and <hi>doſis</hi> of the Tincture, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Extract.

But you muſt note, that in caſe you exhibit theſe remedies in Broth, you muſt expect to mix them, until the Broth be of a temperate heat to be taken, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all the vertue would be loſt and vapour away, by reaſon of its too great ſubtilty.

This remedy is ſo neceſſary by reaſon of the accidents happening every moment in a family, as hurting, burning, over-wearineſs, and colds, that it would be almoſt neceſſary to have it ſtill at hand, to prevent by a ready help and ſure aſſiſtance, the evil conſequences and great griefs which ordinarily follow the beginning of theſe Diſeaſes. <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiis obſta: ſerò medicina paratur, Dum mala per long as invaluêre moras.</hi>

                              <p>FRuits are that part of Vegetables which are leſs regarded and made uſe of in Chymical Pharmacy: wherefore, we ſhall have little to ſay concerning their Preparation. Since we find <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquint</hi> only worth our taking notice, and beſtowing of our pains. And, as it is a Purgative often uſed, and in whoſe correction hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto much error is committed; we ſhall ſet forth only here what Reaſon and Experience have taught us upon that ſubject.</p>
                              <p>Though the moſt famous Chymical Authors have preſcribed to make the Extract of Coloquint with Spirit of Wine, yet do I differ from them in judgement in this particular. Becauſe the Fruit of Coloquints is volatile, and hath a ſubtile and dangerous Salt in itſelf, which cauſes ſtrange colliquations, and corrodes
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170969:148"/>the Stomack and Guts, as it plainly appears, when this unſafe remedy hath cauſed any hyper-catharrs or over-purgings. Now the Spirit of Wine draws from the ſubſtance of the Coloquint, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the volatile and hurtful Salt, without touching the fixt part at all, which is that that truly purges the ſeroſities, clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſubſtances and mucoſities of the body: Moreover, the Spirit of Wine doth ſo ſubtilize and attenuate the Body of the Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quint, that it carries it into the very Veins and Arteries, whence it attracts the beſt and pureſt part of the bloud. The Artiſt then muſt find out ſome way to correct and extract this purging Fruit, that it may yield its faculty very conducing to that end, without any hurt or danger. But it muſt be performed by a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> differing in nature from Spirit of Wine, that it may fix in ſome manner the malignant volatility, which predominates in this Fruit, and cauſes all its ill effects; wherefore the corrective and <hi>Menſtruum</hi> of Coloquint, muſt of neceſſity be diſtilled Vinegar, provided, it be aſſiſted and animated with a fixt penetrating and ſubtile Salt, which may act upon this volatile part, and alter its nature: this Salt is that of Tartar, according to <hi>Sennertus</hi> his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, as we will teach when we come to teach the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon Tartar. For we regard very little here, the pretended cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of ancient and new Diſpenſatories, which reſt only in the pulveriſation and mixture of Aromatical Subſtances and Gum Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, to hinder the dangerous effects of Coloquint. The manner then of the true Extract is this.</p>

The liquor you muſt only filtrate through a Linnen; and, if there remains any ſubſtance of the Body, joyn it again to the new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and re-iterate three times the operation of ſtraining, perco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, filtrating and digeſting in embers, and, ſo ſhall you be ſure to have extracted and corrected all what was good and bad in the Coloquint: Evaporate after this all your Digeſtions to a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency of Extract; whereof keep one half, to exhibit with ſome good Mercurial Preparation in Venerous diſeaſes; as alſo in Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and Arthritical Diſeaſes, provided, your Patient be of a ſtrong and robuſt conſtitution: The <hi>doſis</hi> is from grain ij. to ℈ ſs. and a whole ℈. If it be exhibited without Mercury, you muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe after it a ſmall draught of Malmſey, Spaniſh Wine, ſtrong Mead, or ſome other good generous Wine; or give it in the ſame. But, if there be any Mercury incorporated with the Extract, you muſt preſcribe a ſmall Broth after, wherein you have mixt X grains of Coral, and as much of powdered Mace. But in caſe, you deſire to give the Extract of Coloquint in a larger <hi>doſis,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any danger of doing hurt; you muſt purſue and compleat the due preparation of this Extract: Put it then in a Matraſs, and to each dragm of the ſame add ℈ i. of ſoluble Magiſtery of Coral, and circulate it one whole Moneth in a Matraſs doubled, or Pellican, well luted; having firſt poured upon it Spirit of tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarized Wine to the eminency of four fingers; the circulation muſt be performed in a ſlow heat of <hi>B.

But, as thoſe which apply themſelves to Chymical Phyſick, and conſequently, to the reading of Authors treating thereof, ſhall find in <hi>Rullandus,</hi> and ſeveral others, mention made of a Specifical Spirit againſt ſeveral obſtinate diſeaſes, to whom the name of <hi>Spiritus vitae aureus Rullandi</hi> is attributed, and yet the deſcription thereof is not to be found in the Author it ſelf, and what others do deliver of it, is but conjectural; I have thought it neceſſary, to eaſe the mind of Artiſts upon this matter, to joyn my own opinion to that of others for their ſatisfaction. They that maintain this Spirit to be made out of Coloquint, ſay, that one of the conditions of it was to Purge without Vomit; and that, by conſequence, this remedy could not proceed, but from this fruit, which is the only Vegetable purging with ſo ſmall a <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> and chiefly, being exalted by the help of Spirit of Wine: for, had this Medicine been both Purging and Vomiting at once they would have all attributed its vertue to ſome Antimonial Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but as it is not Emetik, the moſt judicious have believed, that it was Spirit of Wine impregnated by a long digeſtion and Circulation with the vertue of Trochisks Alhandal, which are nothing elſe but prepared Coloquint. Others do maintain the contrary, amongſt whom <hi>Franciſcus Antonius,</hi> a <hi>London</hi> Phyſitian, is none of the leaſt conſiderable: for, they will have it to be a preparation of Potable Gold, or ſome other tincture extracted
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170969:150"/>from this noble metal; and alleadge for their reaſon, that Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quint being a Vegetable cannot extend ſo far its vertue, as are thoſe attributed by <hi>Rullandus</hi> to this his Preparation in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies of his Obſervations; and, that none but a Mineral remedy, or Metallick one, can be capable of this Univerſality of action: and moreover, that it is not without reaſon or myſtery, that this Author gives unto it the name of Golden Spirit of Life, or <hi>ſpiritus Vitae de auratus:</hi> ſeeming to be willing by this denomination, to inſinuate what he would have concealed in his writings. Though it ſeems, that the reaſons alleadged of both ſides are valuable; yet I am forced to ſubſcribe to the firſt opinion, which holds for Coloquint; becauſe I am informed by ſeveral very ancient and creditable Phyſitians, who profeſs to have it from young <hi>Rullandus,</hi> that the Spirit which his Father uſed, and whereof he relates the Hiſtories in his Centuries, was nothing elſe but the Tincture of Trochisks Alhandal: But, that the time, <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> weight of the Trochisks, and their Preparation, was to be obſerved; and, as this remedy is full of many noble vertues, I have thought my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſet it here, though it be not ſo well corrected as the laſt Extract, whereof we have given the deſcription, ſince the acid and fixative Spirit hath not been uſed, but for the Preparation of Trochisks; and, that the Salt which did accompany it was an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali, which deads and bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 <p>ALthough the art of baking Bread, and brewing Beer, ſeems for the preſent vile and abject; yet nevertheleſs, there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned perſons, and even of thoſe which will be accounted ſearchers of Nature, and vers't in her myſteries, that feed upon both, without ever having made a judicious reflection, why theſe aliments do nouriſh and ſuſtain them, much leſs, what portion of them is converted into their ſubſtance for the preſerving of their life. Though ſuch a ſtudy ſhould be the chief imployment of thoſe that undertake to treat of Nature and its Products: and, as we have ſo often ſaid, that Chymiſtry only can introduce Man into Natures Cloſet and Sanctuary, there to diſcover her naked and hidden beauty; ſo will we endeavour to clear this truth, and explain it more eſſentially here than any where elſe. By the deſcription we intend to make of the Introduction of the Leven and Ferment in thoſe ſubſtances by which we are nouriſhed, which doth evidence and manifeſt unto us by its action, what portion of vital ſpirituous and celeſtial ſubſtance there is in the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170969:152"/>matters which are imployed dayly by us for the preſervation of our life. Now we muſt of neceſſity have recourſe to the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Leven, if we pretend to find its original any where elſe, than in the hand of God himſelf, and the nature of Light and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: ſince the action of ferment is all divine; it is properly that fire of Heaven which ancient Poets have adumbrated in the theft of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> and which fince hath been inſtrumental in the propagation of all Arts, ſince it is the only ſharpener of Spirits, which illuminates and guides them to the nobleſt knowledge. For if any do attribute the knowledge of Leven to Tradition, we muſt return to the firſt Inventor which can be no body elſe, but our firſt Parent, who had his knowledge by infuſion; and if we attribute it to Chance, it muſt of neceſſity follow, that the firſt diſcoverer ſhould have found by accident ſome fermented matter which ſhould have made him conceive, that the ſubſtance acting in this fermented body, did open and dilatate it, and introduce in it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral qualities by the alteration cauſed by the ferment, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned him to take notice of ſome new productions, and as a kind of new generation in the fermented ſubject. Now it is not poſſible for any man to have all theſe conſiderations, and make theſe reflexions, without a previous tincture, or acquired and adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted knowledge of natural Philoſophy. And ſo by the help of either of theſe two guides, he muſt have extricated by the help of the External Senſes, that which his Internal had preconceived, or, what is yet truer, his ſmell and taſte muſt have invited him to meditate thereupon, ſince there is no fermentation, without ſome ſpirituous ſubtile and penetrative odour, which ſuggeſts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to our reaſon this concluſion, that ſuch an effect can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be produced, but by a celeſtial agent, and of an igneous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; moreover, the taſte doth meet with a certain biting acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is neither harſh nor corroſive: but, to the contrary, pleaſant and evincing clearly that there is ſome very ſubtile Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hidden therein: which muſt of neceſſity have obliged him who found out the firſt uſe of Leven, to make his Experiment of this fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented matter, with the mixture of ſome other that ſhould na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally incline to fermentation, and ſo came to diſcover the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thereof, which ſince hath ſpread and communicated it ſelf to Poſterity. Nevertheleſs, which way ſoever men came firſt
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:170969:153"/>to the knowledge of ferment and its action; we muſt refer the praiſe and glory of the invention to the Author of Nature, and the Creator of all natural productions; ſince thoſe that have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed themſelves to ſeek its original, and the way of its operation have manifeſtly been convinced, that it had a ſource and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal above Nature it ſelf, ſince all what the ſublimeſt wits have ever been capable to ſay of it, hath never been ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs its Eſſence; they contenting themſelves only to ſay, That as God and his Attributes are the ſame thing, of which the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane mind can only conceive the exiſtency, and whereof alſo we can affirm nothing but by Negatives: ſo likewiſe, the deepeſt Philoſophers acknowledge Ferment and its action: but, they could never come to give an exact definition of what it is, and the manner of its action. For we find in holy Writ, that <hi>Moſes</hi> hath imployed no other term but Gods <hi>fiat,</hi> let the thing be, to expreſs the mind and will of God, which made, as it were, created things iſſue from Himſelf, as very well hath noted one of the moſt learned Phyſitians of our age, when he he ſaith, <hi>That God in the work of Creation, did in a manner open and explicate Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as in a Book, in which he hath left his Picture drawn in moſt beautiful and viſible Characters; as if God had lodg'd and placed himſelf amongſt the Beeings or created Subſtances; that they may the better partake of his goodneſs.</hi> Now as the intention of the Creation was to cauſe a duration and perpetuity of created ſubſtances, by a long ſequel of generations; God placed the ferment or leven in the confuſed maſs of the Chaos, to introduce in it by his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency the Seeds of all ſublunary things, whereof he had the Idea's in himſelf from all Eternity. By which we know Ferment to be nothing elſe, but a ſpark of celeſtial and divine light, harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all individual Subſtances, which nevertheleſs doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the Internal Senſes, much leſs to the External, and yet notwithſtanding doth work perpetually, and reduce all things from power into act, to convey them to the end of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral predeſtination. We have no more at preſent to ſay upon this matter, but, that our ignorance cauſes here admiration; and, that we are forced to depart from contemplation, and ſtoop to action, according to the meaſure of knowledge which God hath permitted us, that is, to imitate, though a far off, and at a
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:170969:153"/>great diſtance the myſteries of natural fermentations by artificial ones.</p>
                                 <p>To attain then to the perfect way of this noble operation, you muſt prepare a portion of the Seed which you are to ferment, that it may entirely be diſpoſed to receive the ferment; and, be capable beſides, to introduce it in a great quantity of the like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared Seed, which is thus performed. Chuſe the time of the Vernal Equinox for this preparation; becauſe, then Nature is in a kind of motion, to make all things bud and germinate in the renewing of the year: wherefore ſhe makes uſe to this end of all the aſtrations or influences of the Stars; which by means of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rain, impregnated with a very ſubtile and efficacious. Spirit and Salt, which renders it penetrative and permeable, more than at any other time of the year, doth ſoecundate the Earth. Take then <abbr>lb</abbr> L. of Wheat, Rye, or Barley, and put it to ſoak in a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Tub in Rain-water gathered in the Vernal Equinox; or, if the ſeaſon will not afford it, in good River-water; let there be no more water then what is ſufficient to ſoak well your Grain, and leave it ſo during 24 hours, then let the water run away, by a hole which is to be under the Tub; after which, take away your Grain from the Tub, and put it in an aired place, but not expoſed to winds; make an heap thereof of the height of one foot and an half; cover it with a Linnen cloth firſt, and a Woollen one thereupon, and ſo let it lye together and ſoftly contract a heat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> until you find that the Grain hath begun to germinate, or bud and ſhoot out a ſmall filament white and very thin, as if it were white Silk; then uncover your grain, becauſe, that filament witneſſes that the heat hath already ſufficiently excited the internal and fermentative Spirit of the Grain, to reduce it from power into act, by the means of that ſpirituous ſubſtance which it had drawn from the water, that had rowſed and excited this Internal Spirit, which before did lye Dormant, and concentrated in it ſelf: for, if you did let it lye longer covered, it would abſolutely fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and turn to putrefaction, which would ſpoil all the inmoſt part of the heap, and convert it into a confuſe and ſhapeleſs maſs, which would degenerate into Earth, and become as a ground and place of nouriſhment to the other part of the Grain in the Superficies; and in a ſhort time would grow and be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170969:154"/>into graſs, by reaſon of the exceſs and abundance of water, and the precipitation of the heat. Now to prevent all theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, you muſt ſpread your Malt or germinated Corn in a well aired place, and permeable to the wind, it muſt not be higher than half a fingers bredth, that it ſhould the ſooner be dryed; ſo ſhall the air and wind diſſipate the ſuperfluous humidity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrate this vital and ſpermatick power, which otherwayes would have vaniſht away, and been loſt and diſſipated by the exceſs of heat and moiſture. When you begin to perceive the grain to grow dry in the ſuperficies, ſtir it often, to haſten the exſiccation of it; and, that the Spirit that was already in action, may recoil and concentrate it ſelf again in its own body; which doth not ceaſe, nevertheleſs, to retain a diſpoſition more inclinable to the production of its own Spirit, than all other Grain which hath not been ſo prepared. And as I have ſaid, that the Grain had ſuckt the ſpiritual and ſubtile part of the water, which was as its own preſervative Salt; we muſt inſiſt a little more in explicating this myſtery for the inſtruction, and in the behalf, of ſuch as are not yet acquainted with the noble actions of Nature, and the wayes ſhe uſes in her operations: Beſides, that it will bring ſome light to what we have already ſaid above, of Ferment and its action. To conceive this the better, it muſt be obſerved, that Nature hath placed in every Individual Subſtance a kind of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiſm, which cauſes it with a quick and ſudden earneſtneſs, to attract whatſoever is analogous to its Internal Spirit, from the things with which it is joyned. Now this Internal Spirit is ſhut up, as inviſible, in the viſible body of the ſulphureous volatile Salt contained in the kernel or groſs body of the Seed, which, to ſpeak properly, is the ſoul and life of the thing: ſo that, when this Grain ſoaks in the Vernal Rain-water impregnated with the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Seeds of all things, it attracts potently and greedily, what is moſt fitting and analogous to advance it ſelf to that perfection to which it was deſtinated by Nature. And, when it is filled with it, it begins to conceive a heat in it ſelf, and to ferment, whereby to produce the bud or germen, which is the principal of all vegetation: which would act and extend its power further, if the Artiſt did not check and draw back this ſtirred power, which, unleſs hindred, would paſs into action. But the cleareſt
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:170969:154"/>and moſt natural proof we can bring, that the Grain hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the ſaline and ſpirituous portion of the water, is, that this water in a very ſhort time will turn to corruption, and doth contract a putreſcency and ill ſmell above all others, which doth ſo offend and irritate the Brain and the Organs of Reſpiration, that it will almoſt choak thoſe that come neer unto it. They that in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>September</hi> uſe to go by the doors of Brewing-houſes, may beſt give teſtimony to this truth: for, thoſe two ſeaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time they prepare greater ſtore of Malt for brewing of their Beer, and the waters lying ſtill in their houſes and the ſtreet, they produce a moſt abominable and nauſeous ſmell. And they that have wrought with Equinoxial water, and preſerved full Casks thereof, know that it never corrupts, and can keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out corruption whole years, which is not ſo with the Rain-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of other ſeaſons of the year. By which it evidently appears, that this long preſervation cannot proceed, but from the ſaline Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which the Stars had as it were darted with their influences into this water; and that, as the Corn hath attracted it by its mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiſm to help germination; ſo the water being deprived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, could not preſerve it ſelf without alteration, corruption, and putrefaction.</p>
                                 <p>Take <abbr>lb</abbr> xij. ſs. of this Grain ſo germinated, or Malt, being dryed, and put it to <abbr>lb</abbr> xxx vij. ſs. of Wheat, Rye, or Barley, ſeverally, or all the three kinds together; and let it be groſly grounded, as Brewers do their Malt for Beer: Having thus your Meal prepared, put half of it in a Cask, newly emptied from Wine, and as much in another; pour upon it half boyling water with Buckets, and ſtir inceſſantly your Meal with a woodden Shovel, or any like Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a four-pinned woodden Fork, to moiſten throughly your Meal, and make as it were a diſſolution of the internal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Grain; and, when you have put 8 or 10 Buckets of ſcalding water in the degree afore-mentioned, and that the Meal is well mixt and allay'd, add ſome cold water, until all be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſo moderate a heat, that the hand may be ſuffered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in without hurt or inconveniency: that done, proportion to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tun of Liquor half a Bucket full of Yeſt of Beer, which ſhall be unto it inſtead of a Leven or Ferment; becauſe this Yeſt is nothing elſe but fermented Flower, which the action of fermentative
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:170969:155"/>Spirit expels out of the Cask as unneceſſary, ſuperfluous and full of feculency, having preſerved yet in it ſelf the fermenting pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which it is capable to introduce in the matter which is to be fermented. Having diligently and exactly agitated and mixt the Leven with the matter, you muſt cover the Tuns with woodden covers, &amp; put on the top a Linnen four-folded cloth, and thereupon a Rugg, and look from time to time if the fermentation begins, which ſhall be noted by the riſing of the groſſeſt part of the Corn above the Liquor, and a ſwelling round about in the figure of an Hemiſphery: Things being thus prepared, take care the matter ſhould not run over, and make too quick an ebullition, which is a token of too much heat or too much leven; and, in ſuch caſe, take away two Buckets full of it, or pour upon it a Bucket of cold water, and then let it work of it ſelf. That which is moſt worthy of a Phyſical Philoſophers conſideration, and more to be admired in the working of this fermentation, is, that when that round ſwelling in the ſhape of an hemiſphery is formed; and, that the Ferment hath raiſed the groſs body of the Grain to the ſuperficies, then appears the wiſe Providence of the Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Fermentations; for it ſerves as a Bulwark and defence againſt the eruption of Spirits, which act upon the matter from the center to the circumference, and play under this incruſtation, until they have diſſolved and volatilized all the parts of the body, upon which they act, except the uppermoſt skin, which is about this incruſtation, which cleaves by intervals, and diſcovers under it a Cream as white as Snow, that dilatates it ſelf and frames bubbles: which breaking, affects the Noſtrils with a ſpirituous penetrating vapour, ſubtile and biting, that tickles the Noſe, and would in a ſhort time ſtupifie and inebriate; if you held your Noſe over the Veſſel, juſt as the volatile and narcotick vapour of Wine would do, when it begins to ferment in the Veſſel. Now as we have engaged by the Fermentation we would deſcribe, to ſhow the nature of that which is performed in mans ſtomack; for a greater evidence of this truth, we will make a parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both: for, as it is evident, that purity is ſeparated from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity; and that the ſubſtances which did ſeem to be heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous become homogeneous by the action of the Ferment, which diſſolves the ſubſtance of the Grain, and mixes it with the water,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170969:155"/>to alter its taſte and odour by communicating the Spirit unto it; the ſame is performed in the Ventricle, where all whatſoever we ſwallow of a liquid and ſolid ſubſtance, doth mix and coaleſce together to become one maſs of the ſame nature, though it ſhould ſeem that what we have taken in, ſhould be of very different kinds and qualities, as hard and ſoft, ſalt and ſweet, harſh and and ſpiced, fat and Oyly, the acidity of the Stomack, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever elſe of ſeveral ſubſtances meet there: all that, I ſay, makes an uniform chyle, by the help of the volatile Spirit, lurking in the bottom of the Stomack, and of an acid nature, as is alſo ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Leven. But, that which doth yet more illuſtrate this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and likeneſs of fermentation, is, the ſmell, which by eructations or belchings is brought ſome few hours after meals to the mouth and noſtrils, which do repreſent the taſte and ſmell of what hath been eaten and drunk; and chiefly, after drinking new Wine or new Beer, the belchings in their ſmell yield by their exhalation, a fermentative and tickling Spirit, like unto that we have mentioned above, which cannot better be apprehended, then by comparing thoſe bubbles, which are formed in the pureſt part of the chyle of our fermentation of Grain, which ſend forth this ſubtile and tickling Spirit that doth invade the Noſtrils; for the ſame happens in the Stomack, and when the eruption of theſe bubbles is made, it forces the action of belching, and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to the ſenſe the taſte and ſmell of what predominates in the chyle. All what we have now ſaid, doth ſhow how much it doth import, that as a Phyſitian ſhould be well skilled in the good fermentation and its effects, ſince from her doth depend the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our health: ſo muſt he alſo be well verſt in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diſpoſition of it, which is for the moſt part the occaſional internal cauſe of all diſeaſes; a truth confirmed by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf, when in his Aphoriſms he ſaith, <hi>That the ſowre or acid belchings of ſick perſons recovering, are of a good preſage;</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies no more in ſubſtance, but, that the Stomack begins to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its ſtrength, and the digeſtion to be well performed, becauſe the fermentative natural acid hath recovered the upper hand; whereby it may ſafely be concluded, and with great reaſon, that all things will go better and better.</p>
                                 <pb n="286" facs="tcp:170969:156"/>
                                 <p>But we return to our Fermentation, which, during this digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we left in its progreſs; the knowledge whereof is of no ſmall importance. We ſay then, that when the Artiſt ſees, that what was lifted up by the action of the Spirit, is fallen again to the bottom of the Veſſel; and knows by the taſte, that the ſwiming liquor on the top hath acquired a taſte between ſweet, acid, and pricking; and moreover, that its ſmell evidences the light to have contracted a vinous and ſpirituous odour, which doth recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Senſes, is of a ſubtile nature, and happens for the moſt part towards the fourth or fifth day; then muſt you anoint the bottom of the Veſſel to be uſed in the diſtillation of hot Spirits, with a piece of Bacon, to hinder the matter in the bottom to cleave unto it, and contract an aduſt taſte or empyreumatical ſmell noxious to the Spirit; after this, agitate your fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a woodden Spatula, to cauſe the ſubſtance in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom equally to mix with the liquor, whereof your Veſſel muſt be filled, till it reach half foot neer to the top; and continually ſtir it, until it be ſufficiently heated by the fire, to raiſe up all the body; then without danger may you cloſe up the Veſſel with its Moors-head or Still, luting the Joynts and quickning the fire, until you can no longer endure your hand to put upon the Still-head without burning; then you muſt exactly cloſe the door of the Furnace and its Regiſters with great care and precaution, and ſo patiently expect until the Spirits begin to aſcend in a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour into the Worm or Pipe, where they are condenſated in a ſpirituous burning liquor, which falls by drops into the Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. You muſt entertain the fire in that degree, until the liquor coming forth be totally inſipid; then open the Veſſel, and draw out the matter to fill it with new; and ſo continue till you have diſtilled all what was fermented. That done, put into the Veſſel again all the diſtilled liquor, and throw into it two pound of new and warm white loaf of Bread, or toaſt it in want of new; becauſe the Bread attracts to it ſelf all what may be of ill favour in the firſt diſtillation; then cover the Veſſel, and give it a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular fire, according to the beſt judgement, until the Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to diſtil, as we have already taught; and ſo continue until the phlegm aſcends, which may eaſily be perceived by the taſte. So ſhall you find after this rectification an <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> or hot
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:170969:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>Spirit, of very good taſte and odour, and little inferiour to that which is extracted from Wine, though the Grain of it ſelf be flat and without taſte, which illuſtrates ſo much the better the wonderful effects of Art and Nature, and verifies the ſaying of that learned <hi>Roman</hi> Philoſopher <hi>Morienus, Quod eſt occultum fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at manifeſtum, &amp;c. è contra:</hi> which can never be done but by the help of ferment which penetrates into the moſt inward parts of Mixts, and diſcovers unto us there, that which our Intellect or Senſes ſhould never have found otherwiſe.</p>
                                 <p>They that will ſubtilize this Spirit by a third diſtillation, may do it, and add upon the whole a Bucket full of Wine-lees: then will it become ſo ſubtile, and ſo delicate, that the moſt skilful may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in their differencing it from Spirit of Wine, either by the taſte or ſmell. It may then be applied to all ſuch operations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and Spirit of Wine are neceſſary; which will be very uſeful to thoſe that apply themſelves to Chymical practice, in ſuch places where there are no Vineyards, or <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> is at a dear rate. I do nevertheleſs adviſe, to keep the Spirit of Wine in Chymical operations, becauſe it is ever more pleaſant, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and penetrative: but, when you are deſtitute of it, you may lawfully ſubſtitute this Spirit, in the compoſition of all ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, where <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> is neceſſary. We ſhall not mention here the vertues of this Spirit; becauſe, beſides that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known for a great warmer, reſtorer; and ſtrengthener; we purpoſe to ſpeak thereof when we ſhall treat of the Spirit of Wine. We muſt nevertheleſs add ſomething more in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of curious Artiſts, which have a mind to make this Spirit, and yet live in ſuch Countreys where they know not what belongs to the making of Beer, and by conſequence have no Ferment or Yeſt, which proceeds from that liquor to raiſe the fermentation of Meal. Now there is no place in the world where Bread is not made, and conſequently, where there is not Leven or Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherewith the Dow is raiſed in making of the Bread; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them take <abbr>lb</abbr> ſs. of ordinary Leven, which ſhall be mixt with <abbr>lb</abbr> ij. of Meal in xv. or xx <abbr>lb.</abbr> of luke-warm water; then let the Veſſel containing all this be covered, and the fermentation of this Liquor be patiently expected, and when you ſee it begin, and the Meal to riſe up on the top, and the Liquor to ſwell,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:170969:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>then introduce this Liquor in any matter which is to be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and you ſhall perceive the effects as we have already ſpoken of to follow, but not ſo quickly as if Beer-yeſt had been made uſe of.</p>
                                 <p>We have but one thing more to add, which is, that to ſtir up the fermentation of Meal or Grains, you muſt put ſome of that which hath already been prepared: but you muſt know, that the Artiſt ſhall not extract ſo much Spirit, that it ſhall not be ſo ſubtile nor ſo delicate, nor have ſo kind a taſte: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that which is more important, is, that fermentations ſhall not ſucceed ſo well, as when this Grain is joyned to the other, which makes it fitter for fermentation, and that when it hath duly been ſo performed, all the diſtillations are much more ſucceſsful, becauſe this Grain, which hath been opened by its preparation riſes up eaſily, and draws up to, and with it ſelf, that which hath not been prepared. And if I am asked, why I have not p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 <p>ALthough theſe Seeds have in themſelves great ſtore of moſt ſubtile, volatile, and moſt penetrating Salt, as may be concluded from their taſte; yet fermentation doth not cauſe them to yield a hot burning Spirit, as many other Vegetables: but it opens them, and rarifies nevertheleſs in ſuch a manner, that all the Salt and Oyl which theſe Seeds have in themſelves, and
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170969:158"/>wherein all their vertue is placed, aſcends in Vapours and Spirits, which being condenſed into Liquor, fall again into the Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, with ſo ſubtile and penetrative a ſmell, that it invades the Eyes and Noſtrils, and paſſes into all the conduits of the Brain, with as much quickneſs as the moſt ſubtile volatile Spirit of Urin might do. It is not neceſſary we ſhould repeat here, the proceſs of Fermentation and Diſtillation; it will only ſuffice, to give the neceſſary precautions for the work, becauſe theſe Seeds are of a different nature from the other, by reaſon of the ſubtility of their volatile Salt. There muſt then a ſpecial care be had, that the Veſſel wherein the fermentation is performed, be not above half full, that the matter may not riſe too high in the action of the Ferment; the ſame precaution muſt be uſed in the Stillato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Veſſel not to fill it above half, to lure it exactly, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the fire with a clear judgement, and an orderly aſſiduity, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe all would aſcend in ſubſtance in the Still-head. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits may be rectified in <hi>B. M.</hi> if they are deſired more purified and more ſubtile than by the <hi>Veſica</hi> or ordinary Stillatory; they are true diuretical and aperitive remedies; above all, to remove the Obſtructions of the Spleen: they are moreover true ſpecificks againſt the Scurvy: the <hi>doſis</hi> and vertue whereof hath been ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied above, when we ſpoke of Antiſcorbutical Plants, whither we refer the Artiſt for his better information.</p>
                                 <p>But as the Oyls and Spirits of theſe Seeds may be extracted without addition; and that more-over it is neceſſary to diſtil them in this manner for external uſes: We ſay the right way of operating to be this: fill two parts of a Glaſs Retort with any one of theſe Seeds, but chiefly of Muſtard, by reaſon of the ſingular vertues of its Oyl: then place it in a Furnace upon an Earthen cover turned upſide down, filled with Sand, which will be unto it inſtead of a Lute; then cover the Furnace, and fit a large Receiver to the Neck of the Retort, and lute it with quick Lime and whites of Eggs, and give it a regulate fire, until the drops begin to fall, keeping it in that tenor until the Oyl begins to appear; then encreaſe the fire by little and little, and urge it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Receiver, which was dark with fumes, begins to clear again of it ſelf, which is a manifeſt ſign, that the action of the fire hath driven into the Recipient all the vapourable ſubſtance contained
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:170969:158"/>in the Seed, and ſo conſequently that no more is to be expected. This operation is commonly ended in the ſpace of 12 hours. All the Veſſels being cold, take the Receiver off from the Retort, and ſeparate the Subſtances that will be found therein, which you may rectifie if you will: but as they are only intended for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward applications, it will not be very neceſſary: but if you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to rectifie them, leave the Spirit and Oyl together, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them in a low Cucurbite, which being covered with its Head, put it in aſhes, and give it a graduate fire, until the volatile Salt and Spirit begin to appear in the Still-head; then keep the fire only in an equal tenor, until the Phlegm begins to aſcend, which the taſte will diſcover: for the volatile Spirit which is actuated by the ſame Salt, is extraordinary biting, ſubtile, and penetrating, and the Phlegm hath only an acid and almoſt inſipid taſte: this done, change the Recipient, and ſtrengthen the fire to make the Oyl aſcend, and ſo continue till nothing more comes away; then ſeparate the Oyl from the Phlegm, put the diſtilled and rectified matters in Glaſs Vials, exactly ſtopt by reaſon of the ſubtilty of this Spirit and its volatile Salt. The Spirit doth wonders being applyed upon ſtarved Limbs, well fermented with Spirit of Wine, and freſh ſtale; then make a liniment with <hi>

The Oyl unrectified, does mundifie, cleanſes and fleſhes again the moſt filthy and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant ulcers, diſſolves the knots and hardneſſes of Gowt and venereous diſeaſes; but you muſt at the ſame time make uſe, and even a little before, of the internal remedies, ſuch as we ſhall teach hereafter to extract out of Mercury and Antimony.</p>
                                 <p>We ſhall not ſpeak here of the <hi>doſis,</hi> not excellent vertues of the Spirit extracted by fermentation, from theſe kinds of Seeds;

We ſhall then Anatomize all the parts which this admirable Plant doth furniſh us withall, being thereunto invited by thoſe excellent remedies it doth adminiſter unto us; although we be bound to ſpeak alſo of other parts then the Seed, which is the proper ſubject of this Section.

                                 <p>The Juniper-wood muſt be gathered with its leaves or pricky excreſcence, and its Berries, whether ripe or not: and ſhred or cut in ſmall pieces, ſo as they may be put in a capacious earthen Retort; which being placed in a cloſe Reverberatory Furnace, the Recipient being fitted with all requiſite and neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, a gradual fire muſt be given to it, and ſo continued until it hath driven out all the Oyl or Spirit contained in the Wood, the true token whereof is, when the Receiver doth grow clear of its ſelf; the time of this operation will not laſt above 12. or 15. hours at moſt. The Veſſels being cooled, ſeparate the Oyl from the Spirit; the Spirit will remain reddiſh, becauſe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with the tincture of the Oyl communicated to the ſame by the volatile Salt of the Plant: if you will rectifie it in Sands or Aſhes, you ſhall have a very pure acid Spirit, provoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sweat, and diuretical: The <hi>doſis</hi> is from ℈ i. to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. in Wine, or ſome convenient decoction; it hath as much, if not more vertue then the Spirit of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> for venerial diſeaſes: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, it is ſingular in the bitings of Vipers, Serpents, or other venomous creatures, if it be given in the ſame <hi>doſis,</hi> and the wound be waſhed with it, and with new ſtale; it is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to rectifie the Oyl extracted from the Wood, becauſe it is not inwardly uſed: It is exceeding good to hinder the accidents of cutting of Sinews, and bitings of any creatures when provoked, becauſe the volatile Salt contained in it, doth penetrate to the deepeſt part of the wounds, where it corrects the malignant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of venom, and hinders its progreſs and further ſpreading: But the Patient muſt take at the ſame time Spirit of Juniper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, in warm Wine, with xx grains of ſcraped Nutmeg. The Oyl moreover, is ſingular to appeaſe the pain of rotten Teeth: it equals the vertue of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> for the cure of old Ulcers; chiefly if they be ſeated near the Joynts where many ſinews do concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, many griſtles, and cartilages, which do feed for the moſt part Ulcers with their jelley, ſlime, and viſcous ſuperfluous moiſture hindering conſolidation: this Oyl doth digeſt and conſume all theſe ſubſtances againſt Nature, and reſtores a good ground, which doth afterward cicatrize and fill up the Ulcer, and ſo brings it to a perfect cure.</p>

It will ſeem perhaps, that we have enlarged our ſelves too much upon the qualities which this fruit muſt have; but as the vertue of the prepared ſubſtance depends on the goodneſs and qualities thereof, ſo was it neceſſary to declare it at large, that the Artiſt may not loſe both time and matter in vain, as it is too uſual a thing to do.</p>

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:170969:160"/>no more Oyl appears on the Water, when you receive or put for trial your Water in a Spoon. This operation ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in this manner, until you have made an end of all your Berries, re-affunding ſtill your diſtilled Water upon each diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after you have ſeparated the Oyl with a Cotton. But if you will make the ſimple Extract, the Honey or Theriack of the Germans with theſe Berries, you muſt ſtrain and percolate ſome part of theſe diſtillations being warmed, and ſlowly evaporate them to the conſiſtency of a thick Syrup, or liquid Extract. If it be objected, That the Oyl is already ſeparated from it, and that conſequently, the vertue of it will be abated, the anſwer is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: for you are to conſider, that the Oyl would be evaporated nevertheleſs, during the coction and evaporation, as is ſufficiently witneſſed by its ſmell ſpreading about, when the Extract is made before the Oyl be ſeparated.</p>
                                 <p>Take all what remains from all the Diſtillations, without ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating any thing, and joyn to it the Cake remaining from the expreſſion of the Extract; fill the Still-body full of it to warm, and ſo by it communicate the heart to the remainder: which, I ſuppoſe, to be put in a Cask or Barrel for fermentation: introduce the Leven or ferment into it with the circumſtances and requiſite pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, and ſo leave it four or five dayes; after which you ſhall diſtil it at ſeveral times, until you have made an end of extracting all the Spirit: the which rectifie in the ſame Still-body (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Veſica</hi>) with <abbr>lb</abbr> vi. of new ſelect and bruiſed Juniper-berries, and you ſhall have a burning Spirit, of very excellent and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vertues: ſeparate the firſt Spirit by it ſelf, as alſo the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and the third, to be made uſe of in ſuch caſes as we ſhall ſay hereafter.</p>
                                 <p>And to let you know, that Chymiſtry loſes nothing of what may be made uſe of, percolate and ſtrain the remainder of the fermented diſtillation, and being warmed, run it through a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cras Bag, or a Flannel; then evaporate it to the conſiſtency of a liquid Extract, which is one of the ſweeteſt and gentleſt Purges that may be uſed: This Purgative faculty will perchance, and not without reaſon, make ſome to wonder at it: But we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this ſcruple, giving to underſtand that the action of the ferment hath diſſolved and united with the Water the beſt part
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:170969:161"/>of the fixt Salt of theſe Berries, and as fix Salts looſen the Belly; it is the ſame alſo, which being predominant in this Extract, doth cauſe its purging vertue.</p>
                                 <p>This done, dry the Cake remaining from all the expreſſions, and calcine it, to make a Lye thereof, and extract the Salt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of according to the method which we have formerly declared, then reverberate it in the Crucible without melting, and diſſolve it in the laſt diſtilled Juniper-Water; then filtrate and evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it to a skin, and cauſe it to ſhoot into Cryſtals, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for your uſe. Thus much we had to ſay upon Juniper-berries: it remains only to ſpeak of the Vertue and Doſes of thoſe noble Preparations, which this Seed doth furniſh us with, and to give you a deſcription of an Elixir or Tincture of Juniper-berries, which is a moſt accompliſht remedy, whereof we ſhall alſo ſay the uſe and proprieties.</p>
                                 <p>We will give to Juniper-berries in general, the vertues which they deſerve, before we come to the particular proprieties of each of the remedies thereof extracted; that this general Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation may ſerve, to make the better our Obſervations, when there ſhall be occaſion to uſe thoſe remedies. And in the firſt place, we ſay, that the principal uſe of theſe Berries is to incite, attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and diſſipate in general: But they are particularly uſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Urine and Sweat, to move and bring forth Lunary Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, remove obſtructions of the Spleen, correct affections of the Brain, Sinews, Breſt, and cure Coughs, diſſipate Winds in the lower parts of the Belly and Colick; and above all, to diſſolve and evacuate the viſcous and ſlimy ſubſtances, and Sand in the Bladder and Kidneys: They are alſo moſt uſeful to uſe as a Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in time of contagious Diſeaſes, either eaten, or uſed by the way of a Perfume, to correct the venenoſity and malignant diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Air.</p>
                                 <p>It is now very eaſie to apply to every one of the Remedies prepared their proper vertue, for it is common to all, ſince they were extracted from that body which contained them, except the laſt Extract, which is purging, for the reaſons before declared. The aetherial Oyl of Juniper is a Soveraign Remedy to provoke Urine, and appeaſe all pains of the Colick; it is alſo an excellent Topical Remedy in all cold affections of the Sinews; as alſo in
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:170969:161"/>the pricking or cutting of Sinews, by reaſon of its penetrative qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but chiefly its Balſamick vertue. The <hi>doſis</hi> is from iij. drops to xv. or xx. in white Wine, or its own Water. The ſpirituous water which is extracted at the ſame time as the Oyl, is diuretical and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphoretical: The <hi>doſis</hi> is from ℥ i to iiij. or ℥ v. but it hath quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother operation, when exalted with ſome drops of its Oyl mixt with Sugar in Powder, to make them diſſoluble and mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As for the Extract made before the Fermentation, it is a very good Remedy of it ſelf to ſtrengthen the Breſt and Stomack, a very excellent diuretical, and ſafe alexitery; therefore it is made uſe of inſtead of common boyled and skimmed or depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Honey, to receive the Powders which enter in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent compoſition, and famous <hi>antidote,</hi> called <hi>Orvietan:</hi> It is a body of a wonderful uſe alſo for the compoſition and incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Subſtances that are deſtinated for Opiats, or liquid Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries, againſt the Plague, all other contagious diſeaſes, and the venerious diſeaſe and its branches: The <hi>doſis</hi> is from <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ſs. to ℥ ſs. But the Spirit is an agent far ſurpaſſing all what we have ſaid, for it penetrates as in a moment the whole body: ſo that it may be employed in all diſeaſes wherein the Berries do conduce. And to prove manifeſtly its penetrating and balſamick vertue, this is a token, That a Patient taking never ſo little of it, ſhall be ſure that the firſt Urine which comes from him, will have a very pleaſant ſmell of <hi>Iris,</hi> or Violets: The <hi>doſis</hi> is from <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ſs. to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ij. in Broths, white Wine, or its own Water: The <hi>doſis</hi> of the other unrectified Spirits of the ſecond and third diſtillation, may be augmented in proportion to the ſubtility of their parts. The Purgative Extract is wonderful, to receive in it ſelf the other purging Remedies either Roſins or Magiſteries, Extracts or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to prepare thereof ſome compounded Electuary, which with its purgative faculty preſerves and advances the vertue of thoſe things that were mixt with it. The <hi>doſis</hi> of this Extract is from <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ij. to ℥ i. either diſſolved, or taken in <hi>bolus;</hi> the quantity cannot be prejudicial, as is that of other purging medicines, becauſe it will never cauſe any <hi>Hypercatharſis</hi> or over-purging, neither make any dangerous Colliquation: but it looſens ſimply and ſoftly the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by a natural deterſion of all the Excrements contained in the Entrails, which is a very requiſite vertue in many ſtubborn and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170969:162"/>obſtinate conſtipations or bindings. There remains only the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Salt to ſpeak of, which is diuretical and looſening, of the weight from ℈ i. to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. in Broths or its own Water, or what is yet better, in <hi>bolus,</hi> in the purging Extract. This Salt is alſo capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble long to preſerve the vertue of its Water, if you diſſolve <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. or ij. in each pint.</p>

It is alſo a Stomachical and Hyſterical Specifick, which by its heat and Alexiterial Balſami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Cordial vertue doth diſſipate, whatſoever may cauſe evil alterations in the Ventricle or Womb. The <hi>doſis</hi> is from ½ ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to 1. or 2.</p>
                                 <p>We have no more to ſpeak of Juniper, but concerning its Gum or Roſin, which is a very good Perfume againſt all defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Brain, if you receive the ſmoke in your hair and round about the Neck, as in the ſtopping of the Noſe, or impediment
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170969:162"/>in the motion of the Neck, or when the Almonds are ſwell'd, and the free ſwallowing hindred; you muſt alſo perfume with it the Linnen which are put about the Neck, and the Head. But the beſt of all, is, that this Roſin, which commonly is called Varniſh, or Juniper-Gum, yields an Oyl by diſtillation, which is wonderful in external uſe for all affections of Sinews, againſt the cold, and the in potency of parts which are fallen into ſome Reſolution or Palſey, againſt all ſhrinking of Limbs, and generally, all cold Aches in all parts of the Body, whereof no evident cauſe can be given, and no ſwelling nor redneſs appears outwardly. It is alſo very efficacious to diſſipate all cold cedema's, or cold ſwellings. And is thus done:</p>
                                 <p>℞ Gum of Juniper Coals and decrepited Salt, <hi>ana</hi> equal parts; reduce them to a groſs Powder, and being well mixt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, put it in a Glaſs Retort, and place it in a cloſe Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratory: fit a Receiver to it, which being well luted, cover the Furnace, and give it a gradual fire, which encreaſe till nothing more comes forth, and the Recipient grows clear, which for the moſt part happens within the ſpace 12. or 15. hours. Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the two ſubſtances which are in the Recipient; for the one is aqueous and acid, which proceeds from the Salt, and the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile part of the Gum of Juniper, with a ſmall portion of its Mercurial Spirit which alſo are acid: the other ſubſtance is ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agineous, inflamable and ſulphureous in ſome part, yet craſs and viſcous: therefore muſt this Oyl be rectified in Sand in a Glaſs Retort with Salt of Tartar, and ſo ſhall you have a clear, ſubtile, and penetrative Oyl, capable of all the noble effects we have attributed unto it.</p>

                              <p>WE ſhall have only two examples to give upon the Rinds in general, the one upon Limon-Rind and Orange-peel, which are volatile, and muſt be diſtilled in a peculiar manner, and with notes that are of concernment, and which the Artiſt muſt attend with care: the other ſhall be upon Rind of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> which is more condenſed and fixt, that theſe two extreams being oppoſed and compared together, may clear the better the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the apprehending of the truth of things.</p>
                              <p>To apprehend the better for what reaſon we are induced to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil theſe volatile Rinds, or Peels, otherwiſe than the Flowers which are no leſs volatile, we muſt take notice of the taſte and ſmell of theſe two Rinds, when they are yet tender, recent, and ſmooth, and compare them with the taſte and ſmell of the ſame, when the fruit hath been kept, the Rind is faded, grown rugged and half dry; for it will appear, that when new and freſh, theſe Rinds will yield a pleaſant taſte and ſmell, which ſubtilly aſcends and inſinuates it ſelf into the Brain, recreates and ſtrengthens it: whereas when the fruit is old and withered, and its Rind ſhrunk in its ſelf; the taſte is unpleaſant and bitter, biting too much, and deſtituted of that vivacity and pleaſant ſteam, which it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; which is, that notwithſtanding, that ought chiefly to be preſerved, if you will have any good ſucceſs in the Remedies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared therewith. To attain unto it, chuſe the time wherein you may have ſtore of new Limons and Oranges in great quantity, and at a cheap rate, and pare the Rind very thin, until you have ij. or iij. <abbr>lb.</abbr> which ſhred in ſmall pieces, and put in a Glaſs Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbite with clear water, until it ſwims ½ foot above the Rind; and diſtil it in Sand with a moderate fire at firſt, which increaſe by degrees, ſo long that the liquor dropping comes out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taſte or ſmell, and no Oyly ſubſtance appears above the ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling water. So ſhall you find an aetherial and ſubtile Oyl, which ſhall have all the delicacy and vertue of the Limon or Orange-Peel
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170969:163"/>Peel, which keep for your uſe in Glaſs Vials exactly ſtopt. It might be here objected unto me, that I otherwiſe proceed than thoſe Authors, which formerly have preſcribed the manner of diſtilling thoſe Oyls: ſince I deſire they may be diſtilled aſſoon as the Rind is ſeparated from the Fruit; whereas others do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to digeſt and ferment the ſame, to purchaſe a greater ſtore thereof. To which we anſwer, that we have not here regard to the quantity, which ought to be the leaſt care of the Artiſt, when he perceives it may bring an alteration to the ſubſtance, and diminiſh the vertue: for as we have noted above, that the ſteam of theſe rinds is ſo ſubtile, that it cannot but with difficulty be preſerved with its own ſubject, ſo ſhall it with much more reaſon vaniſh away, when it is ſeparated from it: and although it be true, that the quantity of diſtilled Oyl will be greater, when the Rind hath been left in digeſtion and fermentation for ſome time; nevertheleſs <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. of that diſtilled according to our direction, will without compariſon exceed in goodneſs and vertue ℥ i. of the other. They that deſire to have yet leſs of Oyl, but will at the ſame time have an excellent Spirit out of the ſaid Rinds, muſt diſtil them with good and quick white Wine, and ſo ſhall they have a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which will not be much inferiour to the Oyl, which we have mentioned above, when we ſpoke of the Syrups made out of theſe Rinds, which will occaſion us to ſay no more for the preſent.</p>

                                 <head>How the Spirit, Oyl, and Salt, Extract Tincture and Magiſtery, of Rind of Guaiacum is to be prepared.</head>
                                 <p>℞ of Rind of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> the heavieſt, moſt compacted, and moſt ſtreaked with black lines, as you can meet with; powder it groſly, and put it in a Retort of Jugge-mettal, which place in a Reverbera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory cloſe Furnace, which we have called above, a Common Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace: to the Neck of which fit a capacious Recipient, the Joynts whereof you ſhall lute with Salted lute; cover the Furnace and let the lute dry, and give it a gradual fire, until you ſee the white va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours to appear, and perceive ſmall drops of a reddiſh Oyl to mix with the veins which the Spirit doth make in the Recipient; then encreaſe the fire, even to flame, until the Recipient grows clearer of it ſelf. You muſt expect until the next day to open your Veſſels, and you ſhall find in the Retort the remainder of the Rinds converted into Coals, which you muſt calcine and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate in a Pot not leaded with an open fire, to convert them to Aſhes, whereof draw the Salt by elixiviation, filtration, and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, according to the manner which we have already ſo many times declared. This Salt muſt ever be mixed in all the Purgatives which you exhibit to thoſe that have a touch of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſeaſes; for beſides that it quickens and helps the vertue of thoſe Purgatives, it purges of it ſelf, and is one of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivenerian Specificks. There is two Subſtances found in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient, one aqueous mercurial and acid, which is the Spirit of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:170969:164"/>this Rind; the other is a craſs and heavy Oyl, which ſinks under this Spirit, by reaſon of the great quantity of volatile Salt, which cleaves intimately to the ſulphureous Oyl, and alſo becauſe a portion of the fixed Salt, which by the violence of fire was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latilized lies confounded in this Oyl; you muſt ſeparate the Oyl from the Spirit by filtration with Paper upon the Funnel, and the Oyl will remain above the Paper, bored with ſmall holes to make the Oyl flow in the Bottle appointed to receive it. This Oyl and Spirit may be externally applyed without rectification: for you may put a little of the Spirit in liquid fomentations, for the waſhing of cancerous, ſlimy, fiſtulous, and corroding ulcers, and principally thoſe which are cauſed by the venenoſity of the Pox: to apply the Oyl afterwards, either by it ſelf, or mixed with ſome unctuous body, which blunts the edge of it, that otherwiſe would become too painful. The vertue of this Oyl cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently be extolled for the cure of all old ulcers, and to diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate Nodus's, but above all, to haſten and to bring to paſs the exfoliation of Bones, provided you mix with it a little of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled Oyl of <hi>Euphorbium.</hi> But if you will uſe this Spirit and Oyl internally, you muſt rectifie the Spirit in Sand in a Limbeck; and as it is an acid Spirit, the Artiſt muſt be warned, that the Phlegm doth aſcend the firſt, and that the biting acid Spirit aſcends the laſt; therefore muſt he ſeparate the Phlegm, and put a new Recipient when he ſhall perceive by the taſte, that the drops which begin to fall are acid. This Spirit doth powerfully withſtand the venemous quality of the Pox, expelling the ſame whereſoever it meets with it, by the way of Urines, Sweats, or inſenſible tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, provided it be impregnated with its Oyl, which poſſeſſes the beſt and greateſt part of the volatile Salt of our Rind, from which it muſt not be deprived if you will preſerve its vertue. To this end, it muſt be rectified in a Retort with the Aſhes remaining after the extraction of the Salt, and the Oyl ſhall aſcend fair, clear, and ſubtile, deveſted for the moſt part of its empyreumatical o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, which it had contracted in the firſt diſtillation: for theſe Aſhes mixt with the Oyl, will retain in themſelves all the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and groſsneſs, but not keep the volatile Salt, which is the active and virtual principle, not only of this Oyl but alſo of the efficacy and power of all ſublunary Subſtances, becauſe it is the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:170969:165"/>laſt ſhelter and bond of the ferment and internal fire of all Mixts; in which reſides the power and energy of all their actions: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Artiſts muſt not wonder, if we ſo often do repeat the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of this Salt, and recommend unto them the preſervation thereof with ſo much earneſtneſs, conſidering we do it not by a vain oſtentation, nor to fall into needleſs repetitions, which are never to be born with, but when abſolutely neceſſary, as it is now for the preſent here in this place.</p>
                                 <p>The general vertues of this Spirit and Oyl are to provoke abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly Urine and Sweat; and by this means to mundifie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purate the maſs of the bloud from all its impurities, to reſiſt the corruption of the parts, and preſerve their uſe, as the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of make it appear in all diſeaſes of the Joynts, running Gowts, Dropſie, Cath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beſides the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal vertues of the Spirit, it is alſo uſeful in Chymical operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the diſſolution of Pearls, Coral, Crayfiſh-ſtones, (Crabs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyes) and the like: but that which hinders moſt its uſe, is, that it alwayes leaves ſome <hi>Empyreuma</hi> or ill ſavour.</p>

The <hi>doſis</hi> of the Extract is from iiij. to x<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> grains in <hi>Bolus,</hi> or diſſolved with ſome ſpecifical burning Spirit: for beſides, that it would not diſſolve in aqueous Liquor, it ſhould come ſhort of the vertue; and though it ſhould happen to diſſolve, there would be a precipitation made of the reſinous and fat ſubſtance, which would never incorporate with the Water, and debilitate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy inſtead of increaſing its vertue. The <hi>doſis</hi> of the Eſſence is from iv. to x. drops to be exhibited to the Patient in burning or hot Spirits of Juniper, black Cherries, or <hi>Elixir Vitae</hi> of <hi>Mathiolus,</hi>
                                    <pb n="308" facs="tcp:170969:167"/>and not in aqueous liquors for the reaſons alleadged above: but becauſe there are many tender and delicate perſons, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure the taſte and ſtrength of theſe Spirits; the Extract or Eſſence may be mixed with a ſpoonful of convenient Syrup, of ſomewhat a thick conſiſtency: for the Sugar keeps back the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and hinders its action upon the reſinous ſubſtance of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract or Eſſence. Theſe two remedies are two ſpecifical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters of all the principal parts contained in the lower-moſt, mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemoſt, and uppermoſt ventricle; it recreates the vital Spirits and animal Spirits of the Brain and Womb: therefore it is excellent againſt all infirmities of theſe two parts: they are alſo very good to ſtrengthen the digeſtive faculty of the Stomack, kill by the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of their Salt and Spirit the Worms which breed in the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, and extirpate totally the ſeminary thereof, as much in aged perſons, as young children, except that a regard muſt be had to the <hi>doſis.</hi>

We have ſaid it ſhould be a capacious Recipent, becauſe that little of Oyl which it yields towards the end would be loſt in new Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, whereas in a capacious Recipient, the laſt Oyl joyns and unites it ſelf to that which iſſued out before. But it is to be noted yet, that what doth diſtil ought to be ſomewhat warm, which is quite contrary to the common practiſe in diſtilling of hot and volatile ſpirits, for the Oyls muſt be ſeparated from their bodies by a ſtrong ebullition, driving the ſame upwards, and raiſing it with the aqueous vapours; but the heat muſt again be temperated, leſt the Phlegm ſhould aſcend in too great abundance with the Spirit; and moreover, whereas in Spirits the Water above the Worm muſt be kept very cool, it muſt not be renewed in the diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Oyls. We did purpoſe to ſet theſe two Notes at large, becauſe the obſervation of them is of abſolute neceſſity in the work. The Water muſt be ſeparated from the Oyl, which will be clear, fair, and yellow, and of a good ſmell: and thus continue your diſtillation till all be ended. This Oyl is excellent for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes outwardly: it may alſo be inwardly applyed, reduced to Sugar, Oyl, or <hi>Elaeoſaccharum</hi> to diſſolve in its Water, or ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uretical Water, for the cleanſing of the Kidneys and Bladder from Slime and Sand; it may alſo be uſed with very good ſucceſs in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles to abſterge and cure Ulcers in the mouth, and waſh and mundifie them in other parts of the body, and particularly in the parts appointed for generation.</p>

                                 <p>THis Wood is brought from <hi>New-Spain,</hi> is tender and dry, though heavy, by which it appears to be more Saline than Oyly, and therefore communicates eaſily its vertue to Water, which it dyes of a yellow-brown colour, in decoction appearing ſomewhat blewiſh in the Surface. We have choſen this Wood to ſhow its difference from others; for although it be inodorous &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid, it is nevertheleſs endowed with much vertue, and expels pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully by Urines, whether ſimply infuſed in cold Water to drink the colature thereof, or mixt alone with white Wine; or whether a decoction be made thereof, which is very inſipid. In this manner
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:170969:168"/>it conduces very much to help thoſe that are troubled with the Stone, Gravel, or ſtopping of Water. But above all, it is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in decoctions againſt the Pox and Scurvy, for it frees eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and powerfully the Patient from the venom of theſe two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; and, becauſe this Wood is not to be found every where, we have thought it neceſſary to teach the manner of its extract, whereby the Artiſt may regulate himſelf in all other Woods, which ſhall be of this kind. Scrape <abbr>lb</abbr> vi. of this Wood, and make a decoction with Roots of <hi>Reſta-bovis,</hi> Hundred headed-thiſtle, or Sea-holy; <hi>ana</hi> 
                                    <abbr>lb</abbr> iij. and <abbr>lb</abbr> i. of <hi>Virga-aurea,</hi> or Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-rod in <abbr>lb</abbr> xxx. of River or Rain-water, till ½ be conſumed: then percolate and expreſs it, and make a ſecond decoction of the cake remaining after the expreſſion in <abbr>lb</abbr> xx. of freſh Water, then percolate and ſtrain it, and ſo continue until the decoction takes no more colour: which done, clarifie all the decoctions, and run them through the bagg, and evaporate it in a ſlow heat without ebullition, to the conſiſtency of a liquid Extract; to which add the Salt extracted from the remains of your Extraction. This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract is an excellent diuretick aperitive Remedy, which may be exhibited from ℈ i. to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. in Broths, white Wine, or decoction of <hi>Lignum Nephriticum,</hi> when thoſe which are troubled with Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, Stoppings of Water, or Nephritical Colick are in the half Bath: but with this precaution, that they take before and render again a Turpentine Glyſter.</p>

                                 <head>To make the Spirituous water and Oyl of Saſſafras.</head>
                                 <p>THe Saſſafras Wood or Pavame comes from <hi>Florida,</hi> and differs yet much in nature from the above-mentioned Woods; for it is very odoriferous; and being never ſo little warmed by rubbing, it ſends forth Spirits which affect the ſmell with much pleaſure, and ſhows this Tree to be very pregnant and full of volatile Salt, whence it is evident, that it hath much vertue. The ſmalleſt is to be choſen for diſtillation, and muſt have yet its Rind about him, and if it were poſſible, ſome of the Root with its Rind; becauſe the Rind poſſeſſes more of the aetherial Oyl, or volatile Salt and Spirit, than the internal ſubſtance of the Wood, which is light and ſpongious, as the ſubtile and aromatical taſte of the Rind, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:170969:168"/>that of Fennel, doth teſtifie: And as we ſaid, that the <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Rhodium</hi> muſt be opened to volatilize it; here we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in a quite contrary method, for we muſt diſtil the Saſſafras aſſoon as it is cut in pieces, and that in a Still-body with Rain-water: but if you deſire to have an excellent Water, and little of Oyl, you muſt diſtil it with white Wine: but if you only aim at the Oyl which is very excellent, have only Water. The Oyl of Saſſafras ſinks in the bottom of the Water, as that of all aromatical Subſtances. The ſpirituous Water is excellent againſt all kind of obſtructions, and chiefly thoſe of the Spleen, which it alleviates more than any other remedy. It is alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent for the Stomach, ſtrengthening the digeſtive heat, and correcting the crudity of aliments, it wonderfully helps the Wind Cholick. It is an infallible Sudorifick or Diuretick; for it will never miſs of its effect by the two natural wayes, becauſe if the Patient will not admit of much covering, and that the ſweat by this means remains concentrated, the vertue of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament will never fail to ſhow it ſelf by Urins: becauſe the actions of Spirits and volatile Salts, can never be hindered; therefore is this ſpirituous Water very ſpecifick in venerial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, as alſo in ſcurbutick diſpoſitions. The <hi>doſis</hi> of this remedy is from i. to ℥ vi. either by it ſelf or mixt in white Wine. The tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture which the Artiſt will draw from Saſſafras, with white Wine, in <hi>B. M.</hi> in a Blind-head, may legitimately be ſubſtituted to the ſpirituous Water, when he ſhall be in haſte and forced to make uſe of it: ℥ ſs. of Saſſafras is enough for <abbr>lb</abbr> i. of Wine; but the <hi>doſis</hi> muſt be double of the Water. Now as the Oyl is more ſubtile than the Water, becauſe it is only made of a little Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur very ſubtile, and all the remainder is only volatile Salt, ſo ought it alſo to be leſs: for it muſt not be exhibited, but from the quantity of iij. to x. drops, reduced to a diſſolubility with Sugar in powder, whether it be given in its own Water, that of Cinamon, white Wine, or Broth, for all the diſeaſes we have intimated here above: but above all, in difficult Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels of women, whether the Child be dead or alive: as alſo to expel the After-burthen, and purge the woman in Travel, without much griping: for this Oyl ſtrengthens the Womb,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:170969:169"/>and makes it diſcharge with more eaſe, and in leſs time, thoſe ſuperfluities wherewith it was incumbred ſince Child-bearing. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, this praiſe may lawfully be given to <hi>Saſſafras,</hi> that it is a kind of <hi>Vegetable Panacea,</hi> ſince the Remedies extracted from it may be adminiſtred in all kind of diſeaſes; and moreover its conſtant uſe may make either ſex fruitful, but chiefly the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male kinde; for it heats, and ſoftly and naturally ſtrengthens all the internal parts; but chiefly thoſe that conduce to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170969:175"/>or violently; ſo likewiſe in Vegetables, are found juyces of ſeveral relliſhes, which analogically do anſwer to theſe excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: ſuch as oyls, Reſinous and clammy ſubſtances, gums and viſcoſities, tartarous and ſaltiſh emanations. There is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe this difference, that animals have conveyances fitted and appropriated by Nature for the disburthening of their ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: which is not ſo in the plants, unleſſe we will attribute it to their poroſity, through which they do exhale and evaporate both good and bad ſmells, as the moſt ſubtil, fine and volatile part of their contents, the groſſeſt remaining in the body of the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; upon which account they need the hand and induſtry of the Artiſt to ſeparate and diſunite them: it ſeems neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that ſome of theſe Subſtances ſtrive naturally to free and ſet themſelves at liberty: for experience teaches, that as ſoon as ſome part of their rind is opened by inciſion, humors will flow from thence abundantly, and therefore obſerve four ſorts of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: Firſt, the aqueous ſubſtances, which are juyces or water, as that which flowes from the Birch-tree and the Vine. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the tereſtrial, which are gums. Thirdly, the Sulphureous, which are Oyles; Balſams, Reſins and reſinated gums: Fourthly, Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſubſtances, as Tartar and Sugar. But as all this we have ſaid; evidences thoſe ſubſtances to be naturally parts of plants, to each of whom we have alſo deſigned a peculiar Section, to teach the Chymical Apothecary what operations he may perform upon the ſame: Our intention is to ſpeak in this preſent Section, of ſuch juyces only as Nature and Art do furniſh us with, <hi>viz.</hi> Wine, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger, and their Tartar; Opium, which is the condenſated juyce of Poppy; and Elaterium, which is the juyce of the wild Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: Theſe three examples will ſuffice, becauſe there will occur e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in them whereby to ground our obſervations both upon the Theory of theſe matters in general, and the practice of their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in particular: and withall to inſtruct the Artſt in all other operations analogical.</p>

                           <head>The Anatomy of Wine.</head>
                           <p>WINE is the juyce of the fruit of the Vine, exhaled by fermentation, which by <hi>Paracelſus</hi> is call'd The blood of the Earth, the juyce of the Prince of all Vegetables, the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Cordial, thought alſo by ſome to be the juyce of <hi>Raymond Lully, his great Lunaria:</hi> others call it again, the juyce of <hi>Janu's plant,</hi> and of the great Vegetable: but leaving all theſe names, let us come to the anatomy of the thing it ſelf, and of its parts. Wine then, firſt of all, does yield by the help of Diſtillation, a moſt ſubtil and incorruptible eſſence, commonly called <hi>aqua vitae,</hi> burning water, ſpirit of Wine, he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>enly Sulphur, Bezoartick ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable Sulphur, Heavenly Menſtruum, Coeleſtial water, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of <hi>Raymond Lully,</hi> the Philoſophers Rey, an aethereal body conſiſting of fire and water, the volatile Balſam of the Catholick or univerſal Liquor, and finally the Quinteſſence of Wine. In the ſecond place, it yields in the ſeparation, great ſtore of inſipid and corruptible water, which is called its Phlegm. Thirdly, there cometh a certain fumous or ſmoaking Spirit, which is nothing elſe but the groſſer part of the volatile ſalt of Wine, reduced into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por, and aſcending under the form of a whitiſh ſmoak. In the fourth place follows, a certain fat, unctuous and combuſtible oyl, but in very ſmall quantity; and fifthly, from the thick and black ſubſtance left in the bottom, is extracted, a penetrating, ſubtil and fixed lixivial ſalt after calcination; and finally in the ſixth place, after the ſalt is extracted, there remains a muddy, inſipid, and needleſſe earth.</p>
                           <p>We have ſaid the Wine was made ſuch only by the help of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, and therefore are bound to illuſtrate it by proof, which we hope eaſily to perform: ſince none that hath converſe with wine can be ignorant, that Muſt or wine in the Muſt was never Wine, and that no body gives it ever the name of Wine, but after Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation is ended: but there is another more Philoſophical proof, and more ſatisfactory to the mind of a Chymical Artiſt, who knows that all whatſoever is wine and is called ſo, yields its Spirit before the phlegm; and that in the diſtillation of Muſt,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170969:176"/>improperly and commonly called ſweet Wine before fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there comes nothing but an inſipid meer water, reſembling that of Rain; which is a convincing proof ſince it falls under ſenſible demonſtration; for after the diſtillation is performed, there remains a pleaſant extract of a ſweet and ſaccharing taſte, containing in it ſelf the eſſential and volatile Salt of Muſt, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For all the Maſſe will ferment, and the liquor by this means contract the taſte, ſtrength, pleaſantneſſe and all other perfections of Wine, by which it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently appears, that Art is capable in ſome way to imitate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that amongſt all other Arts, Chymiſtry alone can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Theory and practice of this Artificial Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                           <p>Now it is not enough to have deſcribed the ſix parts or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which Wine affords in general, unleſſe we come to its particular anatomy: they that will pleaſe their eye, muſt take good wine, clear defecated and ſubtil, of a generous and ſtrong com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and diſtill it in <hi>B.M.</hi> in a grear glaſſe Cucurbit, that they may the better examine, with the eye which all the ſubſtances ſhall aſcend: for when the pure Spirit riſes, the veines will ſcarce ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Still head, ſo ſubtil they are; and when they are total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deprived of phlegm, they aſcend not in a ſtraight line, but are crooked and winding: but when the phlegm begins to mix with them they become more ſtraight &amp; viſible, by reaſon of the waight of water which more viſibly doth incorporate with them; when this comes to paſſe, the Cucurbite or glaſſe-body muſt be expoſed to a Sand-furnace ſomething warm: but the moiſture muſt be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped off from the veſſels firſt, and a graduated fire adminiſtred, to perform thus the whole anatomy of Wine, for the ſatisfaction of the Artiſt. But becauſe this proceſſe is ſlow and tedious, and that the Laboratory of the Chymical Apothecary, ought to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with great ſtore of Spirit of wine of all ſorts, being the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170969:176"/>chief menſtruum of all, and the more conformable to our nature, for the execution of the fineſt operations; we think fit to deliver a more compendious and quick Method of diſtilling Wine; as a ground to explain afterwards all the proceſſes of work which may be done upon it, to render it uſeful to all preparations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, which the ſame Art will take in hand.</p>

                           <head>To prepare the Alkool of Wine.</head>
                           <p>THE Chymical Laboratory, which is the true ſhop of a good Apothecary, muſt be furniſht with ſtore of very ſubtil and very pure Spirit of Wine, whom the Authors uſe to call <hi>Alkool of Wine;</hi> and as it requires both time and ſtore of charges to bring to perfection, I have given the Model of a Veſſel capable at once, and with an eaſie charge to perform this operation, without the trouble of ſo many reiterated diſtillations, which to do the work exactly were neceſſary before this uſeful invention; becauſe the Veſſels wherein the cohobations required for rectification and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koolization
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170969:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>were made, being too low, it caus'd the phlegm ſtill to be more with the Spirit; but in this Veſſel of invention, it is impoſſible the phlegm ſhould ever aſcend, let the heat of the fire never be given ſo great: as it is evident in the latter end of the diſtillation of Spirit of Wine made in your Veſica or ſtill glaſſe-body; for when the phlegm begins to overpower the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in greater quantity, the heat of the fire muſt be encreaſed in a double, yea a treble proportion to cauſe the remaining Spirit to riſe, which is in nothing inferiour in purity, quickneſſe and ſubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the other that firſt aſcended, as it is made evident by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and by the proofs and notes of its perfection: which are, that this Spirit being ſet on a flame in a ſilver Spoon, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Metal, it flyes and conſumes all away without leaving ſo much as a drop of phlegm, or ſign of moiſture in the bottom of the Spoon: The ſecond note is, that a piece of paper or Cotton, or rag of linnen being dipt in this Spirit and ſet on a flame, it doth not only all vapor and conſume away, but moreover enflames and kindles the body which firſt it had moiſtened, provided it has been well dryed before. The third and the beſt note and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible one, is, when the fineſt Gunpowder well dryed is moiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and imbib'd with this Spirit, if you ſee it on a flame it will at laſt conſume alſo the powder; for then it is a true concluding ſign, that no portion of phlegm remains mixed therein: for did there remain never ſo little the Gunpowder would never take fire, wherefore this operation ſaves much time and labour; For when all the Spirit of what was put by the Artiſt in the glaſſe-ſtill body is aſcended, let him only fill a crooked pipe or Spoon with water, and inſert it in the Veſſel by the ſmall channel it has in the ſide, and thus ſhall he empty the ſtill body to the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, without being put to the trouble to take off the Lute of any part of the ſtructure of the Veſſel, and by the ſame channell or conduit may fill up again the ſame glaſſe-body with new <hi>aqua vitae</hi> by a Funnel, and ſo may he almoſt continue unabrùptedly day and night his work without any trouble, provided he takes care to ſupply the fire as it ſhall waſte and conſume away. And if the Artiſt ſhall propoſe to make yet a more ſubtil and refined Spirit of Wine, more penetrating and active then the former, let him put in the bottom of the body of our Veſſel or Engine of Sal 🜿.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170969:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>very dry, and pour upon ſome rectified Spirit of Wine, luting all the joynts after commiſſures of the Veſſels with a Hog or Neats bladder dipt in white of eggs well beaten, then adminiſter the fire until he has drawn again all the pure Spirit, which will have a moſt pleaſing taſte and fragrancy then the former, and be very apt to make therewith thoſe impregnations and imbibitions of Salt, whereof we have ſpoken here above, as alſo for the extraction of many fine and excellent Tinctures. There are ſome which call this Spirit ſo alkolizated upon Salt of Tartar <hi>Tartarizated Spirit of Wine,</hi> but very improperly: for the true Spirit of this nature can be no other, then that through which has been wrought the moſt ſubtil pure and refined part of the Salt of Wine: which is a very painful operation, and deſerving rather the care and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry even of the moſt conſummated in the practice and myſteries of Chymiſtry, then the impatience and unskilfulneſſe of thoſe which are but Novices and young Practitioners in the operations of this noble Art.</p>
                           <p>It remaines onely we ſhould ſpeak now of the great and wonderful vertues of this noble Spirit, which can never be commended or praiſed enough by any body; howſoever ignorant bablers, who are not acquainted with it, may ſpeak to the contrary: for it a moſt penetrative and incorruptible Spirit, potently reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to putrefaction, and to all injuries of cold and froſt: and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I let you judge and conſider, whether there muſt not be a capacity in this Spirit to preſerve living bodies and their parts, being duly and judiciouſly adminiſtred; ſince it preſerves dead bodies; whereof thoſe which keep therein for ſeveral years abortive faetus<hi>'s</hi> may be ſufficient witneſſes, as likewiſe Surgeons, who ſo uſefully and ſucceſſefully apply it for ſtopping the progreſſe of Gangrenes and other accidents tending to corruption of the parts of the body. It revives and awakes the vital and animal faculties: and therefore produces ſometimes ſurprizing effects in Apoplexies, Lethargies, Epilepſies, and all other ſoporiferous affections of the body, where the paſſage of Spirits is obſtructed by ſome groſſe clammineſſe and viſcoſity ſtopping the ſinews which are the Organs of ſenſe and motion: for this Spirit penetrates in a moment even as light, diſſolves and eats whatſoever was the cauſe of obſtruction, and cauſes life and all its functions which were as buried and ſuffocated,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170969:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>to ſhine and appear again; But if it has any conſiderable vertues in internal applications, it ſhows no leſſe eſtimable ones in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal: for by its fiery and Celeſtial quality it diſſipates and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves all cold and ſchirrous tumors, opens the pores and drives or exhales the windy vapors which ſometimes are raiſed between the ſpaces of the Muſcles, cauſing very ſharp pains, it hinders the coagulating of the blood in all manner of contuſions, and ſo prevents all manner of accidents which commonly uſe to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them: as ſwelling, pains, corruption of the extravaſated blood, which of neceſſity without this help muſt putrifie, and would afterwards come to ſuppuration, were all thoſe ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences and ſymptomes not hindered by this Spirit. But above all, this Spirit is a wonderful Specifick againſt all manner of burnings, the grief whereof it allayes, and takes away the wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire from it, with ſuch a ſudden help and quickneſſe, that no pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration or ill impreſſion can happen in the parts offended where it is applyed, not even ſo much as bliſters or riſing puſtulas in the fleſh, provided it be put upon before the skin begins to peel of, and before any other Remedy be made uſe of. But I want words to expreſſe further the worth and vertue of this Heavenly Balſom: wherefore, I leave the reſt to the experience of ſuch as will make uſe of it; which I may ſafely and on my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience aſſure, that they ſhall never be deceived in the uſe thereof.</p>
                           <p>But as the young Artiſts might eaſily miſtake, and equivocate in the rare appellation of Spirit of Wine alkoolizated, which for abreviations ſake is writ <hi>alkolized,</hi> confounding it with Spirit of wine <hi>alhalized,</hi> it is neceſſary to ſhew in wherein they differ, and to teach the way how to prepare the laſt in a more exact and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial way then any hath done hitherto: but before we come to the deſcription thereof we will ſhew the difference between both: which conſiſts in this, that alkolized Spirit of wine, is nothing elſe but the ſaid Spirit pure and diveſted of all phlegm, as we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it above: but Alhalized Spirit of wine, is a Spirit impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with its own ſalt, which is prepared two ſeveral wayes: the firſt by the help of its eſſential ſalt, which is Tartar, and this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not very properly be called Alkalized; becauſe Alkali ſignifies a fix ſalt made by calcination; but when the Artiſt has attained the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170969:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>skill to impregnate the Spirit of wine with its Alkali, it is then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly that he may call it Alkalized Spirit of wine: for that which is prepared with Tartar, is more conveniently named Spirit of wine acuated with his own Tartar, or Tartar ſated. I cannot bury in ſilence the errour of thoſe who pretend by a ſingle diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to unite the very pure Spirit of wine and its purified Alkali to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to make therewith their Alkalibed ſpirit of wine: ſince thoſe that are acquainted with the nature of ſalts Alkali, and that of Alkohol of wine, know that they work not one upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if the ſalt be very dry, and the ſpirit very pure, but if the ſalt participates of the leaſt moiſture, or that in the ſpirit there remaines yet any ſmall portion of phlegm, then will there happen ſome ſmall diſſolution of the ſalt, but there will be no union made of either with other, becauſe they are of a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature, the one being aethereal and combuſtible, the other a ſalt diſſoluble in water: thoſe that know what belongs to true Chymical Philoſophy, can be competent Judges of what we have ſaid, and will confeſſe that not without reaſon we have inſiſted a little on the elucidation thereof, not to prejudice the Chymical Artiſt.</p>

M.</hi> with Saw-duſt, the ſpace of ſix weeks, in a moderate heat imitating that of mans body: This time being over, take away the upper part of your double Veſſel and apply nimbly a Chaptial or Still-head, which luted, continue the fire, but of ſomewhat ſtronger a degree, and diſtil the ſpirit from it till it leaves the bottom dry; then about the end give a very quick fire, and you may then boaſt of having a <hi>tartarizated,</hi> and in ſome kind an <hi>alkalized ſpirit of Wine,</hi> of a ſweet and pleaſing fragrancy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling that of the flowred Vine; becauſe the internal Sulphur of the calcined Salt has in a manner dulled and deaded the edge and quickneſſe of this Spirit, which is very effectual to draw the

It is one of the great Arcana in the practice of Phyſick, and chiefly in tartarous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes proceeding from obſtructions of a fix and tenacious Salt, form'd in the entrals, becauſe in the coction the ſtomach is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of that ſubtil, volatile and energetick Spirit, which is capable either to expel them by inſenſible tranſpiration, or eject them by Urine and Sweat: whence it comes to paſſe that this Spirit is of a ſoveraign efficacy in Scorbutical and all other Diſeaſes of the Spleen and hypocondrical affections, of Aſthma's or ſhort breath, and Cachexye or depraved diſpoſition of the entrals.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170969:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſalt which is its Tartar: and when the Wine is robbed and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the pureſt part of its ſpiritual and igneous Sulphur, then the predominant Tartar changes all the remaining liquor into Vinegar: a ſpeculation of very great importance, and very well worth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; for <hi>Paracelſus</hi> makes uſe in his books of <hi>Archidoxa</hi> of the compariſon of the Sphere of Activity of Vinegrifical Ferment (if I may uſe this barbarous word) to prove the ſtrength and vertue of tranſmutative Tinctures: and the learned <hi>Van Helmont</hi> cannot find a better proof for the ſecret action and hidden intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal power of fire, light, and the internal Ferment of mixt bodies, then by comparing that Ferment with the leaves of bread, and the Ferment of the ſtomach: But moreover, he relates a ſtory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſtrength and power of Spirits impregnated with the Ferment of Vinegar, which is that, if you fill with River water a Cask of Oak very dry, wherein for ſome time before has been put good Wine-vinegar, and expoſe the ſame to the beams of the Sun, during the heat of the Dog-dayes, then the fermentative ſpirit of Vinegar ſhall tranſmute and change by his magiſterial tinging and tranſmutative vertue all this quantity of water into Vinegar; a thing that will appear very poſſible if we reflect upon this, that one pound or two of dough having in it the principle of leaven, are capable to turn a hundred pound of wrought dough, not only into leaven, but to convert them alſo into ſpirits Animal &amp; water: Now the Cask is made of boards or planks of Oak, which is a tree altogether of a vitriolick nature, and whereof by diſtillation a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry potent, acid or ſharp ſpirit may be drawn; but that which is the chief of all, is, that the pores of this wood are filled with the moſt ſubtil parts of the Spirit and ſalt of the Vinegar which it contained before, which retains ſtill in, and with it ſelf the Character and power to convert into vinegas all ſuch liquors as be put in the Cask, provided it be aſſiſted with the Suns or any other conſtant and continued heat that may ſupply its room and office. But that which he notes of more wonder, is, that this Vinegar of water was all ſpiritual; for whereas the vinegar of Wine, ſends forth in the diſtillation his phlegm firſt of all, and yields but towards the end his ſpirit: the vinegar of Water contrariwiſe, doth ſtill ſend forth and yield ſpirit equally from the beginning of the diſtillation to the end, and ſtill with the ſame ſtrength and diſſolutive vertue.</p>

                           <p>CHUSE of the ſtrongeſt and beſt Vinegar you can meet with, and put it in glaſſe bodies or Cucurbits till they be half full, then cover them with their heads and place it in ſand, making but a plain lute with a filter of wet paper: the adminiſter the fire, and the firſt thing that ſhall aſcend will be the phlegm, which is an evident proof that Vinegar is nothing elſe but a wine, which the ſalt and acid Spirit prevailing over the aethereal and ſubtil ſulphur hath fixed. From time to time you muſt examine the taſte of the falling drops, that you may change your Recipient as ſoon as the drops ſhall grow acid, and ſo drive the fire with an equal heat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til all the ſpirit of the Vinegar be drawn, which commonly is called <hi>diſtilled Vinegar:</hi> You muſt note to ceaſe the fire when there is but little of Vinegar left; otherwiſe that which is in the bottom of the Cucuribite would burn, and ſo communicate an ill empyrematical ſmell to the ſpirit of Wine: but to prevent this accident, warm Vinegar to pour again into the Cucurbite, which may be done for three ends: Firſt to exhale and vapour away ſome part of the phlegm of Vinegar; Secondly, to hinder by the heat, that the glaſſe-body ſhould not break; and in the third place, that the new Vinegar may diſſolve the groſſe and feculent one which is in the bottom of the Cucurbite, and ſo ſhall the diſtillation go on without contracting any empyreuma add loſing any time or heat of the Furnaces. But they who intend to make a very ſtrong Vinegar for metallick operations, have no need of all theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, becauſe it is even neceſſary to drive the ſalt which is found in the remainder of the Vinegar into a Spirit, to make it penetrate the better into the bodyes or calpes of Metals: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there ought to be no fear of heightning the fire towards the end, until all the reddiſh fumes or vapour be over, with this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nevertheleſſe, that the Veſſels muſt be well luted, which are to ſuffer ſuch violent fire, becauſe the laſt ſpirits are very penetrating and ſubtil; and as diſtilled Vinegar is a menſtruum of much uſe in Chymical operations, ſo is it requiſite that the Artiſts Laboratory be well provided with theſe three kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> acid phlegm, ſpirit
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170969:181"/>of Vinegar without Empyreuma, and this laſt driven with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſeſt fire, that he may be ſtill ſupplyed wherewithal both to prepare Remedies and ſatisfie his Curioſity, in Philoſophical try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and Experiments, which daily he is invited to make for the ſatisfaction of his mind, and to prove whether his reaſoning is anſwered by ſucceſſe, and know whether all what we have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Authors is true or falſe.

                           <p>Tartar in the <hi>Paracelſian</hi> Phyſick is called whatſoever is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to coagulate in the form of a ſtone, or is already ſo coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; But nevertheleſſe, by microcoſmical Tartar, or that which is ingendred in man, called <hi>Microcoſm</hi> or <hi>little World,</hi> is to be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170969:183"/>underſtood a viſcous and clammy matter, which by want of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion is framed in our bodies, and has in it ſelf an immediate or proximate vertue of harding and coagulating, and conſequently of cauſing obſtructions, by reaſon that it wants a fermentative Spirit, capable of driving them by the natural paſſages and emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, from the center of the body towards its circumference, and from thence to expel them ſenſibly or inſenſibly by the pores: the defect of tranſpiration being the cauſe of the moſt part of internal Diſeaſes no leſſe then external.</p>
                           <p>For the evils and accidents, whereof the Root or ſeminary lyes within our ſelves, ought not to be imputed to the vice of Aliments, as the moſt learned <hi>Van Helmont</hi> doth very well prove in his Tract entituled <hi>Alimenta Tartari inſontia.</hi> Now the <hi>Paracelſian</hi> opinion is the cauſe why the name of Tartar has been given to the Terreſtrial and eſſential Salt which is extracted from ſome Plants; whether it naturally ſeparates its ſelf from their Juyces, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be performed by Art, we have declared above in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Chapter of Vegetables, the manner of ſeparating the Tartars or eſſential ſalts of Plants: but as we can but intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conceive the help of Reaſon and comparing things together, the manner of that which is ſeparated naturally by its own internal working, we will declare our conceit thereof, agreeing with the moſt judicious Authors.</p>
                           <p>The Artiſt to apprehend and conceive the better the original of Tartar whereof we are to ſpeak, ought to call to mind, that the Principles of things are but crude and undigeſted in their original, and as it were but crude and homogeneal in this diſpoſition of their Chaos: but afterwards by maturation there is a ſeparation made of the groſſe parts from thoſe that are more pure and ſubtil: the groſſe parts naturally do encline to the elementary ſtate which is aqueous and terreſtrial; but thoſe that are ſubtil do exalt, and to ſpeak more properly, ſpiritualize themſelves, by the power and ſtrength of their internal Principle or <hi>Archeus,</hi> which contains in its ſelf the ferment and Spirit, by whom they are alſo reduced to the other elementary ſtate which is Aereous and fiery, that is to ſay, participating of the aethereal and Celeſtial nature. Which Philoſophical conſideration, if it may be ſuitable to any ſubject, it cannot be applyed more lawfully to any thing then to Wine:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170969:183"/>for when the Muſt is newly drawn off from the Grape, it is a true Chaos, until the eternal <hi>Archeus</hi> or Principle hath raiſed up and excited the fermentative Spirit, which cauſes the ſeparation of the ſubtil parts from the groſſe, and ceaſes not from its work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it has brought the ſubſtances into which it works to the higheſt pitch of their natural Predeſtination, which is the fiery and Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial part of Wine: and that which is groſſer, doth return as by a Reinundation to that aqueous, earthly and ſaline nature which creates Tartar, which is an eſſential, permanent and incorruptible Salt in its ſelf, but on whom Art and fire may imprint ſeveral alterations, becauſe it contains very Rare and remarkable Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, of near reſemblance to the nature and Power of Spirits, by the help of its ſalt and ſulphur, which it poſſeſſes abundantly.

It is alſo a very convenient Remedy for all ſuch as are naturally cauſtick and cloſe in their bodies; for it will open and gently looſe the Belly, without offending either the ſtomach or digeſtive Faculty; The Doſis is from ℈ i. to ℥ j. or i j. in broth, or ſome aperitive or digeſtive Decoction. But becauſe this Remedy is deſtinated to open the obſtructions of the Spleen and Liver, and that Iron or Steel, is one of the choiſeſt Specificks which may be made uſe of for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Chymical Artiſts have found a way to unite and aſſociate the Steel and Tartar together, by their Reciprocal action work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one upon the other in their diſſolution, which is thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>

After this the Spirit muſt be rectified in aſhes, with this Note, that as Tartar is a ſalt which has its original from Wine, ſo likewiſe the ſpirit it yields is of a very reſembling na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: that is to ſay, that the ſpirit of <hi>Tartar</hi> is not of the nature of acid Spirits, which yield their ſpirit the laſt: but contrariwiſe, it has two kinds of ſpirits in it ſelf, the beſt and nobleſt whereof aſcends the firſt, and this is the volatile Spirit, the phlegm follows after; and for the laſt follows an acid or ſtrong Spirit which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath found no great uſe in Phyſick. The Oyle may be kept without Rectifying to uſe externally: But if in caſe you will make it more Penetrative, more Diſſolutive and Reſolutive, you muſt alſo Rectifie it upon ſome of the remaining matter after Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and you ſhall have an Oyl capable of producing ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects as we ſhall attribute unto it hereafter.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170969:186"/>a Cork dipt in wax, that it return not to a Liquor, which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is called <hi>Oleum tartari per deliquium,</hi> being nothing elſe but the Liquor of the ſalt of Tartar diſſolved, and according to our <hi>Great Paracelſus,</hi> the water or Liquor of Tartar. But when you have occaſion to uſe either this Oyle of Tartar or diſſolved Salt, you muſt let one half of it lye in an earthen or ſtone-metal Pan, this Salt being the moſt penetrative of all calcined ſalts or Alkali, penetrating even through glazed earthen Veſſels: wherefore I have thought fit to give this warning, that the Artiſt may not be deceived herein. Some may perhaps wonder that we did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe above, to take well purified ☿ wherewith to make this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation; ſince all other Authors ſeem to be contented with Tartar as it comes from the Cask, provided it be pure and clean; whom we muſt ſatisfie, and ſhew that it is not without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and very good grounds that we have ſaid it. We have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above why it was neceſſary to depurate the Tartar, by reaſon <hi>viz.</hi> of its Feces, and earth, and ſome other adventitious mixtures, which are ever found in this matter. Now all theſe impurities are capable of being calcined in the diſtillation, and do commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate their ill taſte and ſmell to the ſpirit of the Tartar, which commonly is attributed to the fire or Empyreuma: a reaſon why this Spirit is very little made uſe of internally, though one of the beſt Remedies in Phyſick. Let thoſe whom this truth will not perſwade, compare the penetrating and ſubtil taſte of the purified ſpirit of Tartar with that which is not purified, and they will know, that with very good reaſon we have been obliged to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and redreſſe this miſtake, the cauſe ſometimes of much more evil then is thought of, becauſe theſe Heterogenities have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſome noxious quality, which not only communicates it ſelf to the Spirit, but very intimately mixes with the ſalt, and imprints and ſtamps in it an evil Idea, which cannot be corrected in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Remedies which the Artiſt is obliged to make; and conſequently may often cauſe very dangerous accidents, which will elude the gueſſe and ſuſpition of the Phyſitian.</p>

We have ſaid that a portion of the diſtilled Oyle could be kept without Rectification, and that not without reaſon: for this Oyle abounds with internal ſalt, which remains in the bottome whileſt the Rectification proceeds: and this ſalt it is which by its active and penetrative vertue cauſes thoſe noble effects which this Oyle doth produce, in the cure of the Scurf, Tetters, and corroding and ſharp running Humors. For as we have ſaid, that the volatile Salts bear an antipathy to ſharp and corroding ones, by which both ſcurf and Tetters are produced; ſo is it likewiſe the volatile ſalt of the ſulphur in the Oyle which kils the acidity or ſharpneſſe, dryes and reſtores the skin to its natural ſtate; and this Oyle is not uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful only to ſuch a purpoſe, but even works miraculouſly in reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Tophus<hi>'s</hi> and knots about the Joynts of Gouty perſons and infected with a touch of the Pox, provided they have been purged before with ſome good preparation of Mercury, joyned to a well corrected extract of <hi>Coloquint.</hi> The recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Oyle is to be outwardly uſed, but with precaution and care, by reaſon of its penetrability and great activity: but it may be mixt in ſuch Oyntments as ſhall be prepared for ordinary ſcabs, ſcabs called <hi>Canine,</hi> and all manner of Venerean ſcabs internally: It is exhibited for the wind-Colick in white Wine, and ſpirit of Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, againſt fits ſuffocations of the Mother: The Doſis is from ij. drops to vj. The ſalt of Tartar is of it ſelf a potent Agent, and which ſhould produce unexpected effects, were it not ſo unpleaſant to take, by reaſon of its lixivial and urinous taſte: for it is the moſt ſubtil and penetrating of all the fixed ſalts, both uſed as a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170969:187"/>Remedy, as alſo a very uſeful and convenient ingredient in the ſeparation of ſeveral other excellent Medicines: they that will uſe it without correction, may adminiſter it from gr. vj. to xxx. in Broths or Decoctions, to evacuate and expel by ſtool and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine all ſuch matter as cauſes the itching and all eruptions of the skin, ſcratches, itches, ſcurf; provided, that at the ſame time ſome Oyntment be made uſe of wherein is diſtilled oyle of Tartar, and a little ſalt of <hi>Saturn.</hi> But we will deliver the manner how to cleanſe it and take away its ill taſte, rendring it Purgative, which of it ſelf will be a very good Remedy, and an Inſtrument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides for the performance of many noble operations in the hand of skilful and knowing Artiſts, who by meditation, ſtudy and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſhall attain to the myſteries which it poſſeſſes: The Oyle of <hi>Tartar per deliquium,</hi> is of wonderful effect in the extraction of all the purging Vegetables; For when the <hi>Menſtruums</hi> that are employed therein are impregnated and acuated with a ſmall proportion of this Liquor, they penetrate into the very center of Bodies, extract their vertues, and correct at the ſame time the noxious quality which may be in them, and that by means of the heavenly and Magical Fire, which the ſalt of Tartar has borrowed from the light and the Ayr.

To bring then this operation to paſs, Take pebles out of Brooks, or Rivulets falling from Mountains, that are rocky and full of woods, and if it be poſſible where ſome adjacent ground may contain metallick veines, and where the waters and ſmall Rivers may abound moſt with Trouts well ſpotted with red Purple ſpots, high in colour; for this will be an infallible ſign, that the peble ſtones contained in thoſe Brooks or neighbouring Grounds, contain in themſelves embryo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Metals, which before and after Calcination begin to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: before by external marks and ſtreaks, which are red, green, blew, Purple veines, and mixt with ſome other colours arguing their metallick Tincture: and beſides, becauſe that even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly are not only found ſuperficial ſpots and colours, but in ſome alſo are found ſmall ſcales and grains of perfect and true Metal, holding proof as gold and ſilver upon the touch-ſtone, as I have oftentimes made the tryal my ſelf upon ſtones which were brought from about <hi>Cled<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>To begin then this operation: Fill a great Crucible with ſuch ſtones, and in a Wind-furnace bring them to a full redneſs; and being thus fire-red, throw them in a Baſon half full of freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by which means they become brickle and eaſie to be reduced to Pouder in a Morter; after which, you muſt grind them on a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170969:190"/>Porphurie Morter or Sea-ſcale — until it be reduced to Alkohol, or impalpable Pouder, which having well dryed, mix it in a hot Morter with five times as much of ſalt of Tartar, very pure and very dry; you muſt have at leaſt <abbr>lb</abbr> j. of this mixture in a great <hi>German</hi> Crucible, ſo capacious, as that the half or two of it may remain empty, to give way to the raiſing and boyling up of the matter; whilſt it is melting in the extream heat of the wind-Oven, your care alſo muſt be whileſt it runs in the Crucible, to draw off with the point of ſome Iron Inſtrument ſome of the melted matter, to try if it be reduced into the ſubſtance or form of a green, yellowiſh-glaſs, clear and tranſparent, but you muſt ſound the Crucible to the very bottom, to try alſo whether all the Pouder or duſt of the ſtones be melted, and united with the Salt; which if you find to be ſo, take off immediatly the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible from the fire, and throw the vitrified matter or Glaſs in a very hot Morter, and with a hot Peſtle alſo ſtirring it well, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to Pouder; for if you did give it the leaſt leiſure to cool, it would immediatly be reſolved into a viſcous or clammy Liquor, which ſhould ſhut up the Sulphur, and hinder that the Alkohol of Wine might not have its operation upon it; Heat the Matraſs be-you put in the duſt of this Reſoluble Glaſs, and pour thereon by degrees of very ſubtle ſpirit of Wine, until it be moiſtened and penetrated on all ſides; then pour of the ſame Spirit three or four fingers high above the matter: put the Veſſel in ſand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready warm, and apply a competent fire to it to bring the Spirit to a ſimpering: the Veſſels muſt be covered and ſtopt with the ſame precautions as in the foregoing Tincture. The Extraction being made, and the Alkohol of Wine loaden with a fine red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, draw it back and filtrate, then pour on new, and ſo continue to diſgeſt, extract, and filtrate until the Spirit takes no more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. All theſe Tinctures joyn together, and draw back the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in <hi>B. M.</hi> with a ſlow heat, until you ſee a very red Tincture, of a very good ſmell, and a fiery, penetrating and piercing taſte, then ceaſe the fire and draw the Tincture, which you are to put in a Viol of a very narrow neck, ſtopt if poſſible with a glazen ſtople exactly fitted, or with Cork ſteept in melted wax, and a double wet bladder over. This noble and excellent Tincture preſerves its colour &amp; vertue, much longer then that which is extracted from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170969:190"/>meer ſalt of reverberated Tartar, becauſe the ſalt hath drawn from the pebles their metallick Sulphur, which is of a ſolar nature: now the ſalt cannot retain this Sulphur when it is put to digeſt with pure ſpirit of Wine, becauſe the Sulphur immediatly is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the ſpirit of Wine, which is an aethereal and volatile Sulphur, which by the mutual analogy and ſympathy they have together, extracts and draws it from the center of the leaſt part of the ſalt. This Tincture hath a more diffuſe and general vertue then the foregoing: therefore it may be exhibited not only in all diſeaſes, for which we have mentioned the other to be fit and uſefull, but it may moreover be adminiſtred in all intermittent Feavers, and chiefly in the Quartane; as alſo in all Chronical Diſeaſes, which for the moſt part propagate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by reaſon of the depravation of the internal Faculties, which this Remedy repaires inſenſibly, as by a Miracle. Above all, it is to be uſed in obſtructions of the Kidneys and Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether proceeding from viſcoſity of clammy humors or ſand: or whether alſo the Diſeaſe be occaſioned by the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Archeus</hi> of thoſe parts, which is immediatly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed by the eradiation of the vertue of that ſolar Sulphur ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in this Tincture. We ſhould never make an end, ſhould we relate here of all what both antient and modern Authors have operated upon Tartar, or what our own experience hath drawn from it. It ſuffices that we have ſufficiently enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Artiſt, to guide himſelf both in the Theorical and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Part of the preparation of this Noble and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Salt; which conceals and contracts in it ſelf the greateſt part of the myſteries both of Art and Nature, unto which the Artiſt will never fail to attain, if he learneth to chuſe well his Wine, Vinegar and Tartar, and applyes himſelf with induſtry to the Work and ſtudy of it: which two things are the main props of all Chymical Curioſity.</p>

                           <head>Of Opium, which is the condenſed juyce of Poppy.</head>
                           <p>OPIUM is one of the chief ſtumbling ſtones of thoſe which are Sectators of the pure Galenical Phyſick, and have ever avoided to ſet their foot in the ſanctuary of Chymiſtry: which Averſion can only proceed of their want of knowledge in natural things, and a true experience of their Vertues: For <hi>ut ignoti nulla cupido, ita nec cura;</hi> and as nothing elſe but Nature it ſelf and natural Philoſophy, which is Chymiſtry, can have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by diligent ſearch and labour, and reiterated Experiments, that Opium is not ro be feared nor rejected from amongſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, whether it be raw and crude as it is brought to us from the Eaſt, or prepared according to the Rules and Preſcriptions of Chymiſtry: So is it not to be wondred at, if they that call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and yet have never been ſearchers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, do every day deſpiſe what they never knew, but by the Teaching and Reaſoning of ſome Profeſſor who has only read that Opium was unfit to be uſed, and that it was condemned by <hi>Pliny</hi> and by <hi>Galen;</hi> which is too ſufficient an Authority (in their Judgements) to be condemned by ſuch as openly profeſs and make it a ſcruple of Conſcience, not to follow blindly their Maſters; and ſwear as they ſay, <hi>in verba Magiſtri.</hi> But that which is yet much more to be wondred at, is, that they will by a ſoveraign and Magiſterial Authority eſtabliſh in their Hearers a Belief and Aſſent of their Doctrine, without being obliged to prove it by effects and real Demonſtration; and the worſt of all yet is, that they will treat injuriouſly ſuch as are not willing to condeſcend to their Opinion: Though theſe laſt, either An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or Modern Writers, are grounded upon the Baſis of true and ſolid Reaſon, whoſe right foundation is Experience. For it is not enough for a Chymical Philoſopher to ſay, that Opium may be prepared and corrected in ſuch a manner, as it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſively be inwardly taken: Since this were no better then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely to confeſs, that it is naught and dangerous of its own nature; But a true Naturaliſt muſt ſearch the reaſon of things in their
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170969:191"/>very ſpring; to examine if that which produces the controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quality, is of it ſelf good or bad. Now all thoſe that are verſt in the Hiſtory of Plants, know that the Poppy, from which Opium is taken, is a plant which in all times has had its uſe and credit in Phyſick; and likewiſe the Opium, as without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie it is proved by the Syrups which are compounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, by the ſeed put in Emulſions, and by the Opium it ſelf, which without any due preparation, is uſed in the compoſition of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuaries in all diſpenſatories, and whence they have the name of <hi>Opiates:</hi> Whence it is plain, that the Poppy hath at all times been allowed amongſt the beſt Practitioners, in the number of Remedies. Which thing to examine a little more ſtrictly, I ſhall entreat all impartial and unprejudicated Judges to conſider, that the ſyrup of white Poppy, that of the red-flower Poppy, and all the kinds of <hi>Diacodium,</hi> are nothing elſe but Extracts, or Juyces of Poppy mixt with ſugar to reduce them into Syrups, which are every day made uſe of in all kind of diſeaſes, whereto they are proper, with very good ſucceſſe: and whoſoever will make a judicious and unprejudicated reflection upon Opium, which is the <hi>Maslak</hi> of the <hi>Turks,</hi> or the <hi>Meconium</hi> of Latins, ſhall find that whatſoever efficacy and vertue is in theſe two condenſed Juyces, comes but from the ſame ſpring from which both the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups and <hi>Diacodium</hi> did originally derive theirs. For whether it be that the water draws the vertue of the heads of Poppy which contain its imperfect ſeed, and that this vertue be alſo concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated in the Syrup: it is likewiſe the ſame vertue which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from theſe heads of Poppy by their bare inciſion, which occaſion thoſe drops that by little and little are condenſed, and yield that thick and condenſated Juyce which is the true <hi>Opium</hi> or <hi>Maslak of the Turks.</hi> Or whether alſo this expreſſion draws the vertue of the Juyce of Leaves or tender heads of Poppy, which make the <hi>Meconium or groſſer Opium;</hi> We muſt acknowledge, that either the Poppy and its preparations are to be baniſht from the uſe of Phyſick; or if the Decoctions, Syrups, and <hi>Diacodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> continue to be in uſe, then the Opium or even the <hi>Meconium</hi> cannot be rejected, ſince they proceed from the ſame Plant: and that theſe Juyces thickned and condenſated, have nothing elſe in themſelves, but contractedly what the foreſaid Remedies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170969:192"/>and afford in a larger bulk and proportion of matter. But if any body would object, that the Decoction and Sugar only, take what is good in the Poppy, and that the hurtful part remains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, we muſt have recourſe to the anatomy of the Plant to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this objection; and ſay, that this Plant is compounded of groſs and ſubtil parts: that the groſs are the herb and juyce which eaſily is drawn from it and in good quantity; that in this Juyce are inviſibly contained the ſubtil parts, which are an external and material Sulphur, unſeparably mixt with another internal Sulphur, and with volatile, mercurial and ſulphureous Salt, which are folded in and ſhut up in the groſs and tenacious Maſs of the ſubſtance which conſtitutes the Opium, and hath much of groſs ſalt and terreſtrious or earthly parts in it ſelf, but chiefly <hi>Meco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium.</hi> Now as Poppy is not yet ripe nor well diſgeſted when em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to make Syrups, Opium and <hi>Meconium,</hi> ſo as the ſulphur cannot yet ſufficiently be concentrated in the ſeed, to hinder the predominancy of the ſalt, which is ſo mixt with it as to be yet embryonated, and ſo diſſolved and united to the water which is added in the compoſition of the Decoction, or the water of its own Juyce; an evident proof, that the ſame vertue which is diffuſed in the Decoction, whereof Syrups are made and all the kinds of <hi>Diacodium,</hi> is more contracted and united in the Juyce, which naturally comes forth out of the heads of Poppy whereof the Opium is made by Inciſions, or extracted by expreſſion, as the <hi>Meconium</hi> is. All this we have ſaid above, tends only to ſhew, that it is a wrong and injury done to the Art, to uſe with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and great commendations thoſe common Remedies which by coarſe and rude preparations are taken from the Poppy, and for the moſt part diſtaſte the Patient by their quantity and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſſe; and to forbid obſtinately thoſe which are invented by Chymical Phyſitians, who have moreover ſeparated the purity from its impurity, and ſo judiciouſly with ſo much Art, have redreſſed and corrected all the defects which might be attributed to Opium; and that beſides, they preſcribe it in a very little Doſis and ſmall proportion; they have ſo much altered the caſe and odour thereof, that thoſe which without being acquainted with it, take upon themſelves to traduce and cry it down, would be much put to it to know it, if laid before them without being told,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170969:192"/>or put in ſome ſuſpition or gueſs thereof by having ſome ſmal light from Chymiſtry, which might beſt of all teach them. But to add yet more weight to what we have ſaid, let us join Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Ratiocination: for that true Touch-ſtone will teach us, that whole Nations uſe every day <hi>Opium</hi> or <hi>Maslak</hi> very pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt without interruption, for the richer ſort, and <hi>Meconium</hi> for the meaner ſort of people, and that without any previous preparation, and in a very exceſſive Doſis, ſince they take it from ℈ꝭ. at leaſt to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>.j. wholly, without receiving thereby any hurt or prejudice, have only a kind of giddineſs in the Head as if they were drunk; which hath made the proverbial Reproach, You have taken Opium: as if we ſhould ſay amongſt us, You are drunk. To confirm this Aſſertion, we have all the moſt authentick Records and famous Relations of thoſe that have travelled in the <hi>Indies</hi> and the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;</hi> chiefly amongſt the <hi>Mahumetans:</hi> who all believe that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium doth raiſe their Spirits, makes them more couragious and bold, and cauſes them to undervalue dangers and perils. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> take it to hinder ſadneſs, and prevent melancholly from ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them; as alſo to be more enabled to ſatisfie longer the luſt and luxurious inclination of the <hi>Indian</hi> women. It is true, that the ſame Authors do tell us, that if thoſe that are not accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to it would at firſt undertake to uſe as much at once, as thoſe that by cuſtom have made it familiar to their nature, they may fall in very dangerous and ſad accidents, and run even hazard of their lives: but that ought not to bring a prejudice and aſperſion upon Opium to reject it abſolutely, ſince the hurful quality with which it is upbraided, proceeds only from the exceſſe made by them that take it without having been acquainted with it before, and habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated their bodies to the ſame by little and little: juſt as if Wine ſhould therefore be diſ-eſteemed, becauſe ſome body may be diſ-ordered by it, either by an over-proportion of what he takes, or becauſe he is altogether unacquainted with it. Do we not ſee that Tobacco either taken in ſmoak, chaw'd, or in ſneezing-pouder, cauſes very ill and ſurprizing ſymptomes in all thoſe which are not accuſtomed unto it, bringing a ſudden giddineſs upon them; vomiting, cold ſweats, even as if they were at deaths-door; and yet nevertheleſs when they have made it habitual, ſome are ſo wedded to the uſe of it, that they can by no means be taken from
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170969:193"/>it, or deprived of that comfort. Therefore we muſt never raſhly give our Judgement of the ill effects which are produced by the exceſſive uſe of any thing, otherwiſe we muſt condemn the beſt things that are ſought for and appointed for the preſervation of our life, witneſs this Axiom in Phyſick which ſaith, that <hi>Omnis repletio mala, panis autem peſſima;</hi> and thus much had we to ſay concerning Opium, and thoſe which daily make uſe thereof with very good ſucceſſe in their practice, to maſter Diſeaſes and correct their moſt dangerous and troubleſome accidents. We will only add to this before we come to the practical part, a word very conſiderable; and it is this, That I believe to have found the reaſon why Opium doth not make ſo great an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the Eaſtern people, according to my Judgement as upon <hi>Europaeans:</hi> Becauſe theſe drink Wine or ſome other fermented Liquor for the moſt part, ſuch as are Cider, Beer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the others drink none but commonly water. Now the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Liquors do exalt the Narcotick and Soporifick ſulphur of the Opium, and by the ſubtility of their ſpirits convey it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very Veines and Arteries, where it makes, or is capable to make (I ſay Opium) many dangerous impreſſions, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in too great a Doſis; or not prepared with all the exactneſs acquired. I conclude then, this Theorical Diſcourſe of Opium by the proteſtation I make, to have expoſed none but of the beſt and moſt exact preparation, according to the preſcription of the moſt learned and famous Practitioners of our Age, and that in greater quantity then any Apothecary of <hi>France</hi> ſince 30 years has done, without ever ſeeing any ill accident to happen contrariwiſe; I have ſeen ſo many, ſo admirable, and ſo lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible effects, that I will be ready all my life-time to acknowledge in thankfulneſſe, and to praiſe thoſe to whom I am obliged for the knowledge of this Heavenly Remedy: The preparation whereof followes, according as ſtudy, labour and experience have taught it me.</p>

                           <p>I Do not queſtion, but ſome carping Critick will ſay, that I have omitted in the foregoing Diſcourſe, the Diſpute of Controverſie ordinarily rais'd in the Schooles, between thoſe that maintain O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium to be cold, becauſe it was the opinion of ancient Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and others, who affirm it to be hot: becauſe their ſenſe, and the experience of its effects, ſeem to force us to entertain this this opinion, and to aſſent unto Truth. We would have handled Queſtion <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> had it not been that we profeſs Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Philoſophy; whoſe preſcription it is, we ſhould attend the things and not the words, and not judge of the truth thereof by the ſeveral imaginary degrees of their qualities; but rather dive into the knowledge of the internal eſſence of mixts by their Anatomy, which gives a true light, and diſcovers unto us what Principle it is which predominates in natural bodies, that from thence we may fetch the true Indication of their peculiar proprieties, and the uſes whereunto they ought to be applyed.</p>
                           <p>To perform this Creditably, we muſt begin in the choyce of Opium or <hi>Meconium;</hi> for it were pity the Artiſt ſhould ill beſtow his time and his materials: Therefore, he muſt have the capacity to judge betwixt good and bad ones, and the ability to diſcern between the ſophiſticated, adulterated, and that which is not legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate and skilfully prepared; <hi>Nam bonum à malo, falſum à vero diſcernere periti eſt Artificis.</hi> But as the true and right <hi>Maslak</hi> of the <hi>Turks</hi> can but difficultly and rarely be met with, whoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are a very ſtrong and unpleaſant ſmell, of a yellow colour, inclining ſomewhat to the redneſs of Lions hair, very bitter, biting and fiery in the palate, and upon the Tongue, ſo that it ſeems to ſet it on a flame, being compacted and well united in a heap, as a ſmall Cake conſiſting of many ſmall grains of ſeveral colours, becauſe in gathering the drops flowing from the Inciſion made in the Poppy-heads, there will ever ſome corn of the ſeed be mixed with the flowing Liquor: It it neceſſary we ſhould give ſome notes of Direction to chuſe the beſt and pureſt of that which is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170969:194"/>called <hi>Meconium,</hi> drawn by Expreſſion from the juyce of Poppy-heads bruiſed, or by the mixtue of the juyce of the leaves: it were to be wiſht, that thoſe from whom we have it, would be contented with this coarſe preparation without ſuper-adding other Juyces to encreaſe the Maſs: for the Cakes of Opium which are brought from <hi>Natolia,</hi> are ordinarily of the weight of ℥ iiij. or <abbr>lb</abbr> φ. at the moſt, whereas thoſe that come from <hi>Alexandria, Aegypt, Venice</hi> and <hi>Marſilia,</hi> are for the moſt part of a pound weight, whereby it is eaſie to diſcover that thoſe who drive a trade of it, do encreaſe the weight thereof at leaſt of one half part.</p>
                           <p>The Sophiſtication of it is performed three ſeveral wayes: The firſt is, with juyce of Glaucium or Apple of Love; but this Cheat is eaſily diſcovered with diſſolving it in a little water, which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly turns yellow as if Saffron had been in it. The ſecond is done with juice of Endive and wild-Lettice, but this alſo is known, in that when you cut the Cakes of Opium or <hi>Meconium,</hi> the inſide is ruffer and leſs ſmooth, and has a more mixt odour, obſcurer and more difficult to be diſcerned. The third and laſt way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe is done with Gum, which alſo is very eaſie to be diſcovered, for the Cake is more brickle and more ſhining; and moreover, this is the worſt ſort of all having much leſſe ſtrength and vertue. By which it may be evident, that the true notes of <hi>Opium</hi> can be no other then thoſe we have already aſſigned, except that the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conium</hi> which is the moſt common ſort amongſt us, is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact and united, more black and ſtrong in ſmell: but it is not ſo bitter, harſh and biting in the mouth, by reaſon of the other parts of the Poppy mixt with it, which are not yet exalted, nor their volatile ſalt concocted, as is the juice proceeding from the head alone, either by inciſions or Expreſſions. The Artiſt then having choſen his Opium ſuch as he ought to have, muſt cut it in very ſlender ſlices, which he ſhall ſprinkle in an Iron-pan with good Roſe-vinegar until the Opium be reduced to pap with the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, by agitating and ſtirring of it with an Iron-ſlice; then put the pan on a very ſmall fire, and ſo by degrees dry the Opium without encreaſing the fire to prevent burning, until it be wholly dry and be crumbled from its lump, and reduced to a pouder and making no more ſmoaks. This pure and ſingle operation produces two conſiderable effects: The firſt, that by its ſlow and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170969:194"/>exhalation and the continual agitation of its external ſulphur, it drives away the impure and undigeſted Opium, by which all thoſe diſorders which commonly happen and are feared, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. The ſecond is, that it corrects and fires in a manner the volatile ſalt of the ſame by the acid ſpirit of the Vinegar: and that moreover, it changes alſo the bitterneſs and the ill taſte there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: The Chymical Apothecary ſhall keep this Opium thus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in his ſhop, to uſe in the compoſition of all ſuch ordinary Remedies when that Ingredient is required; as alſo to make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the moſt exact and Philoſophical preparations, according to the preſcription which we will give hereunder.</p>

This general Extract of Opium may already in a manner be called <hi>Laudanum,</hi> ſince it is the ground and foundation of all others, and that without any either danger or ſcruple it may be uſed in many Occurrences, chiefly when the Chymical Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary ſhall be yet unprovided of the other kinds of <hi>Laudanum,</hi> which are more exalted, and admit of ſome other Ingredients in their compoſition appropriated to the diſeaſe in hand, or intended for help or eaſe of ſome particular part of the body.</p>
                           <p>Before we attribute any vertue to this plain <hi>Laudanum</hi> or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Opium, we are obliged to prove that it is not capable of any of thoſe ill effects, which the moſt circumſpect and leſſe venturous are affraid will happen from the uſe of Opium: which ill effects are, as they ſay, that Opium ſuſpends and doth ſuppreſſe the excretion of Excrements and ſtops the paſſages of Urine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nums and enervates the limbs, changes the natural complexion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a leaden colour of the face, cauſes cold ſweats, ſhort breath and difficult Reſpiration, and in progreſſe of time a perturbation of the Senſes and Spirit, makes drowſie and ſtupifies all the animal and vital Faculties. But we have ſhewed that whole Nations make uſe of crude Opium without any Corrective, and yet never fall into any of thoſe ſo decantated accidents, except giddineſſe, whereof they are as eaſily freed after the firſt impreſſion is paſt, as thoſe that have been inebriated with Beer, Wine or <hi>aqua vitae.</hi> Wherefore we may conclude with much more reaſon, that well depurated and well corrected Opium after the way we have taught,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170969:195"/>ſhall not be capable to produce any of the evil ſymptomes which commonly are feared from it, provided that thoſe who ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it either to ſound or diſeaſed bodies, exceed not the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Doſis, which at firſt muſt ever be ſmall, to avoid the ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of thoſe accidents which might be occaſioned by the too great quantity: And moreover, conſidering that it is ever eaſie to add, but very difficult, if not impoſſible to diminiſh it when once let down into the ſtomach, let this be ſaid by the by upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions of the Doſis, which ought to be from <hi>gr.</hi> j. to iiij. and vj. <hi>gr.</hi> We add now the ſingular and noble Vertues wherewith this excellent Remedy is endowed: which are firſt to appeaſe all irritations, inteſtine, ſeditious and violent commotions of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, diſquietings, rages, fury and madneſs of the <hi>Archeus,</hi> which is the principal Director of the Spirit of Life, and conſequently of health and ſickneſs; re-ſtabliſhing again peace and concord, and maintaining it between the Motor and motions of the Body: ſo that after it has ſoftly appeaſed the pain and allayed the grief, it procures a ſoft and pleaſant ſleep, which reſtores nature to its ſelf, and repaires the ſtrength of weak Patients brought low and attenuated by reaſon of pain, diſquiet and want of ſleep, and ſo without doubt is at leaſt half of the Cure of the Diſeaſe of what nature ſoever it be: for <hi>ſomnus reparat vires, feſſaque membra le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat,</hi> by which we may conclude, that, <hi>Natura corroborata est omnium morburum medicatrix,</hi> for which truly I can have a proof from <hi>Paracelſus</hi> out of the fifth book of his <hi>Archidoxa,</hi> in the Chapter where he treats of the <hi>ſpecifick Anodine,</hi> of which we have been moved to ſpeak by ſeveral cauſes, having had ſometimes in hand ſuch kind of Diſeaſes, as all our Arcana's have failed us in the cure of them, except the only <hi>specifick Anodine</hi> which has produced wonderful effects, by us the leſſe admired at, becauſe we know that by the courſe and Law of Nature water does quench fire, and that in the ſame manner the <hi>Anodine</hi> extinguiſhes in all ages the pains of Diſeaſes, and that for ſeveral Reaſons which we now omit. For that which ſleeps is at reſt, naturally commits no fault: If then the <hi>Paroxyſme</hi> is ſet aſleep, it cannnt be felt, but if it be awaked his operation goes on and will be felt. And in this Remedy have we one comfort more, that ſleep takes away and diſpels much grief, pain and melancholy. But it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170969:196"/>here, that it is not neceſſary the man ſhould ſleep, but on the diſeaſe it ſelf; wherefore we frame a Specifick which encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the diſeaſe alone, and combates not the whole man; as it muſt be underſtood of Feavers, where it is neceſſary to make uſe thereof; for are there things hurtful to the whole man and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible in the diſeaſed man: which makes us to ſet upon the diſeaſe, and ſo prepare the Specifick that it may have no operation upon the Body.

The one half of the oyle may be laid aſide without Rectifying, for it may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in many occurrences were there is no neceſſity to have it ſo ſubtil.

The ſecond oyl which hath been rectified, is alſo very good to the ſame purpoſe, for it digeſts with much more ſpeed: above all, it hath a wonderful operation to diſſipate all Tophus's, Schir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſities and Nodoſities, and cold gout, mixt with a little ſpirit of ſalt, and very ſubtile ſpirit of wine. This mixture is alſo very ſalutiferous to all thoſe that have any member fallen into Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or benummed with Palſey; for it doth inſinuate it ſelf into the parts, and conſumes and diſſipates the ſlime, which did hinder the illuſtration and flowing of the ſpirits upon the parts by their obſtruction, or rather reſuſcitates life, and reanimates the ſpirits in the members already deprived of it, and as it were half dead.

                           <p>WE rather chuſe to take Common Turpentine, then a more ſubtile kind, becauſe this in a manner is more natural, and more fully poſſeſſes the mercurial and balſamick parts, then the other ſorts: It is this which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> calls <hi>Reſina de botin;</hi> and though ſome are of Opinion that it is inferior, and yields in vertue to that of <hi>Cyprus</hi> or <hi>Venice,</hi> we are nevertheleſs of another judgement; for although the other be clearer and more pure, this hath, notwithſtanding, ſome volatile mercurial ſalt, which is not abundantly found in others; the proceſs thereof working upon it, is as followeth. Put <abbr>lb</abbr> vi. of Common Turpentine, which is the gum of the Larix tree orſhrub, in a great and capacious retort of glaſs, in which the two third parts muſt temain void of matter or thereabouts, becauſe the heat cauſes the Turpentine to riſe, and ſo if leſs crouded, might run in the body out of the neck of the retort, inſtead of riſing in cloud and vapours as it ought to do: which to procure, you muſt put in the empty ſpace of the retort above the Turpentine, a good handful of Flax or Tow, that it might hinder the ebullition and riſing of the matter: Put your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort

Thence muſt the Artiſt conclude, that this ſpirit is good and uſeful to clenſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170969:202"/>the viſcoſities, impurities, and other ill diſpoſitions of the lungs, ureteries, ſpermatick veſſels, and kernels of the <hi>prostatae</hi> and <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtatae,</hi> when any irritation of thoſe parts doth happen, or any other unclean matter lies lurking in the ſinuoſities and ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of thoſe parts, which can neither be removed nor corrected by the help of mundifying and balſamical remedies, capable of keeping and preſerving their ſtrength without any alteration, to conveigh it along with themſelves into the parts which are in need of it; for we muſt make a general note of very great importance for that part of Phyſick, which is to take indication of the effects of Remedies, chiefly of thoſe that are to be imployed for the diſeaſes of the kidneys and bladder; for all thoſe Medicaments which are endowed with a ſulphureous, balſamick and volatile ſalt, preſerve their inviolable vertue in the digeſtion it ſelf, and carry it even into the diſeaſed parts, as the odour and ſmell of the urine doth witneſs, no leſs then the colour, by which it evidently appears, that no ill alteration is made by it; but that contrariwiſe, the Remedy hath overcome and had the victory, ſince it hath paſſed through ſo many places without ſuffering corruption; but inſtead thereof, hath rather advanced to ſome a greater degree of perfection by natural heat: For the Urine of ſuch as have taken Turpentine, or its ethereal oyl, hath an evident ſmell of Violet or Iris root: and to give a more convincing proof thereof, you muſt know, that it is not the Turpentine only which produces this good and pleaſant ſmell: for the Nutmeg, Macis, Cloves, juniper berries, Parſly, Fennel, dock-roots or carrots, Parſnips, do all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the ſame ſmell of Violet to Urine, by reaſon of their bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick and ſulphureous volatile vertue, which is exalted and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the ſpirit and ſalt of the urine; a myſtery not worthy of ſmall conſideration for ſuch as will take the pains to examine Remedies by the effects of natural digeſtions, to know how far may extend the ſphere of their activity. But that which is yet more to be wondred at, is, that Turpentine diſſolved in a Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, by the vertne of its ethereal oyl, penetrats thorow all the membranous and nervous parts, where it imprints the character of its own vertue, and forces an aſſent to this truth by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſmell it leaves in the Urine, by which it appears, that there is no danger to adminiſter Turpentine, or any remedies in the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170969:203"/>compoſition whereof it enters to wounded perſons, either by the mouth or by glyſters, becauſe the effect thereof can never be but very ſucceſful and redound to the good of the Patient, and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Phyſitian or Surgeon; it muſt alſo be acknowledged, that as thoſe ſubſtances which exalt themſelves into a good ſmell, give a teſtimony thereby of the good they are capable to do: ſo contrariwiſe, thoſe who degenerate into an ill ſmell, and diſturb the Oeconomy of the kidneys and bladder, ſhow that they have ſome ill quality in themſelves, which is to be ſhunned, as much as the other embraced and put in uſe.

                           <p>The yellow oyle, and balſom, which is nothing elſe but the red oyle, differ not very much in vertue, therefore they may either joyntly or ſeverally be applied; for they do heat, attenuate, mundify and conſolidate equally; which makes them very uſefull and fit to be imployed with very good ſucceſſe for reſtoring members benummed or contracted by cold and froſt, for ſchirrous tumors, old running and rotten ſores, gangreen, chil-blanes, whoſe ſores it cures and conſolidates ſpeedily and perfectly, but the balſom ſooner then the oyle.</p>
                           <p>But becauſe the Aethereal oyle which is drawn from common Turpentine is not ſo ſubtile, nor pleaſing to the ſmel or taſt, as that which is diſtilled from the Venetian in a cucurbite, we muſt teach
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170969:203"/>how the Artiſt ſhall well and exactly perform this operation. To this end muſt he take <abbr>lb</abbr> viij. of Venice Turpentine of the cleareſt, moſt florid and odoriferous: for all theſe markes betoken that it is new, and conſequently better; put it then in the cucurbit or glaſſe body with one head; and poure upon it 12. pints of roſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and viij. pints of white wine, adding thereto xxx. lemons cut in thin ſlices, then cover your veſſel and give a fire of the tenor of that with which you diſtill Aqua vitae, and thus with one operation ſhall you perform 3. things: for in the firſt place you ſhall draw an ethereal very ſubtile oyle, and of great efficacy, and fragrous ſmell: ſecondly you ſhall have a very excellent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uretical ſpirit: and in the third place a water wich may be uſed to adminiſter the oyle in it, being firſt mixt with a litle ſugar in powder, and may be uſed in the ſame diſtillation. I do not queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but that many will ſay that this is a very chargeable way of procuring oyle of Turpentine, and that ſo much trouble is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſince one pound of it may be had cheapter then Venice Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine does coſt. But let thoſe that be of this opinion conſult their own reaſon, and conſider the ſmell and vertue of the one and the other; let them make trial thereof, and they will then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the difference between both: therefore I exhort the Chymical Apothecary never to regard coſt or labour, becauſe either of theſe two ſpared will load his conſcience, or leſſen his reputation. Our Artiſt then to proceed, muſt be carefull to change the recipient, when there ſhall be about <abbr>lb</abbr> iv. or v. of liquor in it, to ſave the trouble of rectifying the ſpirit; and the diſtillation being ended, and the veſſels cooled, he will finde the maſſe of Colophonie in the bottom of it, which is nothing elſe then the body of the Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine deprived of its ethereal oyle; it muſt be ſlowly melted in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to ſtraine it afterwards through a cloth or tamy, to purifie and ſever it from the ſlices of Lemon. And as Colophony is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a portion of the reſin, ſo may it lawfully challenge the ſame vertues, except that it is not ſo penetrating or active; for it heats and dries, agglutinates and conſolidates, and as it eaſily melts and incorporates with unctuous and fat ſubſtances, ſo is the principal uſe of it to bear a part in the compoſition of plaiſters and ſalves; it may alſo be us'd in Opiat's inſtead of decocted Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine: but I rather adviſe that Turpentine ſhould be us'd, which

                           <p>THAT which in the ſhops is called gum Elemy, is the drop or reſin of a kind of Cedar which growes in Ethiopia: the beſt is that which is of clear and whitiſh colour, mixt with ſome ſmal yellow parts or ſtreaks, reduced into a maſſe, and being made to burn or flame, yeilds a ſmel which is not unpleaſant. You muſt beate your gum Elemy into powder, and mix with 3. parts of pounded bricks and 1. of decrepitated ſalt, and put all in a retort, which muſt be placed in a reverberatory cloſe furnace, upon an earthen pot-cover turned upſide down, with a litle ſand on it, then fit to it exactly a receiver, and give it a gradual fire, untill it yeilds no more oyle, a part of which may be kept without rectify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but diſtill the other mixt with iij. p. of decrepitated ſalt, and make your rectification of it in a retort, in ſand. Either of theſe two oyls is not to be taken inwardly; but they are ſpecifick and ſingular for all diſeaſes and griefs of ſinewes, cheifly againſt palſy and contraction of nerves, which renders the parts lame and uſeleſſe.

                        <p>GUM refines participate and come near the nature of gums, in that they are nothing elſe but the drop of certain trees, and may with great eaſe be diſſolved in oyle, and in water alſo, but more difficulty, becauſe they participate more
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170969:204"/>of the ſulphureous oyly and inflammable ſubſtance, then of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line which is the ſooneſt diſſoluble in water. They that come near this category or are in it, are Camphir, Maſtick, Ladanum, Benjuin, Styrax, myrthe, and others which it would be needeſſe here to rehearſe: we will then declare a method of the work that may be made upon the cheif and moſt uſefull of them.</p>
                        <p>Gummes ſo properly called, are nothing elſe but concrete li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors eaſily diſſolved in water or other wateriſh and moiſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums, as wine and vinegar: they are of 2. kinds: the firſt do conſiſt of a volatile ſalt, predominant and ſomewhat ſulphureous, and of a gummy viſcous and clamy juice, proceeding from plants, ſhrubs and feculaceous trees, as Ammoniak, Galbanum, Opopanax, Euphorbium, Sagapenum, Aſſa faetida, and ſeveral others: the ſecond are purely gummous and muſcilagineous, proceeding alſo from ſome plants and fruit trees, as gum Arabick, gum of plum and cherry trees, and Tragacinth: theſe cannot ſuffer diſtillation, having none or litle of ſalt and ſulphur in themſelves.</p>

                           <p>BENJUIN is one of the beſt and nobleſt gums which is found in the Kingdome of vegetables, as much for its ſweet and pleaſant ſmel, which outwardly is uſed in perfumes, as princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally for the eſſential vertues it poſſeſſes in it ſelf, proceeding from the abundance of volatile ſulphureous ſalt, whereof we ſhall give an evident proof by the following operations: for it might very well be ſaid, to ſpeak properly of Benjuin, that it is a dry balſom; it is brought from <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Sion,</hi> and grows on tal trees whereof in convenient time the rind is opened, to give way to this precious gum; the beſt is that which in ſome kinde is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, mixt with white granes and ſtreaks, in a yellowiſh red maſſe or lump, apt to crumble, not very heavy, melting eaſily, and of a very ſweet and pleaſant odour. We ſhall give the proceſs of the following operations upon it for the ſatisfaction of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Of drawing the tincture Magiſtery, flowres, oyle, manna or Cryſtal, and Mercurial ſpirit, and that balſom or groſſe oyle of it.</p>

                           <head>To make the tincture and Magistery of Benjuin.</head>
                           <p>℞ ℥. 11 BENJUIN of the beſt note, reduce it to a very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile powder, which being ſearced through a ſilke Tamy that all the heterogeneous ſubſtances may be ſeparated, put this powder in a Matraſs and poure upon it ℥vi. of Alkohal of wine prepared upon ſalt of ♀ becauſe if there was the leaſt of phlegm mingled with it, the operation might be checkt thereby: agitate nimbly the matter and keep the matreſſe in a litle of lukewarm water, and the Benjuin will diſolve in a very ſhort time, which is an infallible argument to prove that this refine containes a very pure and ſubtile ſulphureous volatile ſalt: for if it held a groſſe and unctuos ſulphur, the Alkohal of wine could make but a ſimple extraction of it, and not an intire and perfect diſſolution: if it alſo did particpate of a groſſe and earthly muſcilage, it would by no means hold proportion nor agree in matter with the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and ſubtilty of our vital ſpirit, neither with that of the ſpirit of wine. For as the remedies extracted from Benjuin are made uſe of for the diſeaſes of the breaſt and lungs, it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of all neceſſity, that the matter whereof they are extracted is compoſed of very ſubtile, volatile and balſamick parts, that they may be guided and appropriated by the help of the Archeus to the diſgeſtions of the diſeaſed parts, <hi>ſervata &amp; illibata ſuae virtutis poteſtate.</hi> The diſſolution which ſhall be red and tranſparent, muſt be filtrated in a very dry Vial: for if there was the leaſt moiſture or aquoſity, it would inſtantly turn the tincture into white, and precipitate it to a Magiſtery. Keep half of the tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in a vial by it ſelf, which muſt be very well ſtopt, to uſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion. But if you will have very well depurated Benjuin, precipitate the other part of the diſſolution in very cleer common water; and when you have drawn off the ſpirit of wine again, in a ſmall cucurbit in the vapour of Balneo, the Magiſtery will be left in the bottom, then draw off the water by inclination, and waſh this pure Benjuin with roſe water, and dry it ſoftly; we will give it the name of <hi>Magiſtery,</hi> though ſomewhat improperly, becauſe many Authors have ſo. The Tincture is not much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170969:206"/>ſo named; for it is, to ſay truth, but a diſſolution: the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereof is nevertheleſs encreaſed, by reaſon of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and nobleneſs of the Menſtruum; wherefore it may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be uſed both inwardly and outwardly. Outwardly applyed, it is a wonderful Coſmetick, clenſing the skin both of the hands and face beyond any other, taking away all ſpots, dries pimples in the face, and takes them away, as all other tumours, buds or redneſſes in the skin, reſolving patiently all harſh and malignant ſeroſities which the outward air hinders from tranſpiring, becauſe the face is not covered as are the other parts of the body; and the matter being thus kept in betwen the fleſh and skin, it cauſes thoſe ſeveral defects of it. To make a right uſe of this Tincture, apply it towards bed-time upon all the places where you find need, and the next day waſh the place with Barley-water wherein Veal hath boiled, which you ſhall turn to a milk colour, with ſome few drops of the Tincture of Benjuin, and then ſweep either face or hands (as you have applyed it) with a very dry and ſoft linnen cloth. But beſides this outward uſe in repairing ſuch defects of the skin, if after being raiſed, you uſe at any time waſhing with the white water made by this Tincture, it will prevent for the future all pimples, raiſing of the skin, or redneſs which often happens by ill preparation of the ſoap-ball, and the lixivial ſalt, which has ever ſomething of fieryneſs that enters in the compoſition of it. Inwardly it may be given for Aſthma's and Short-breath; and to phyſical perſons, or ſuch as are troubled with old Coughs, from ij. drops to x. or xij. in a new raw egg, or a ſpoonful of Syrup of Hyſſop, made after the deſcription which we have given above; it may be given in the morning faſting, and the evening two hours before ſupper. As for the Magiſtery, it may alſo be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred in new laid eggs, or ſome pectoral Conſerve, from iv. grains to xv. and xx. for thoſe which are offended by the ſmell and taſte of ſpirit of wine: It may alſo be mixed in Electuaries and Tablets; they that will make good waſhing-balls, and ſuch as may never endanger by any ill accident the skin of thoſe they will trim, muſt prepare and waſh carefully their ſoap, to diveſt it from the ill quality of the lixivial ſalt, and leave in it only the mundifying and abſterſive vertue; and when it is brought to that paſs, waſh it, and feed it a good while with tincture of Benjuin,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170969:206"/>adding thereto ℥ſ. of the Magiſtery to each pound of ſoap, after which they ſhall frame their balls of the bigneſs of ℥ij. and let them dry ſoftly; add if they are pleaſed to add a little of Musk and amber-greece, they may boaſt to have waſhing-balls better for the perfume and ſweetneſs, and more uſeful for preſerving and clenſing the skin both of face and hands, then thoſe of Bolonia ſo much accounted of.</p>

                           <p>As Benjuin Flowers are excellent in their Vertue, ſo muſt an Artiſt be careful to beſtow upon them a good preparation: for which reaſon, we ſhall demonſtrate two ways thereof: The firſt more plain, becauſe it may be done at all times, as neceſſity ſhall require. The ſecond to be reſerv'd, when we ſhall treat of the <hi>Distillation of Benjuin.</hi> As for this firſt manner, take only a good <hi>Germane Crucible,</hi> round and ſomething high, wherein put ℥ij. of Bnjuin reduced to pouder, place it in ſand upon a Capſula, and cover it with a long ſharp cap of a good double blew paper, ſtrong and well ſtiffened, the ſaid cap being proportionated in its baſis to the orifice or mouth of the Crucible: After this, give your fire by degree, and when you perceive the vapours of the Benjuin beginning to riſe, take away the ſaid cap, and put a new one of the ſame matter and proportion in the room, that you may have time to take away with a feather the flowers ſublimated in the firſt, and loſe not thoſe which ſhall riſe while the Crucible ſhall remain uncovered; and this work continue till all the volatile ſulphureous ſalt of the Benjuin be ſublimated in flowers; they are to be given from three grains to half a ſcruple in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and for the ſame diſeaſes, as the tincture and magiſtery: it is by this operation that our Artiſt ſhall clearly know, that Benjuin poſſeſſes a volatile ſulphureous Salt, very ſubtile and penetrating: for as ſoon as there is heat enough to drive it out from its body, it invades the noſe, eyes and breſt, which it irritates in ſuch a wiſe, as to provoke ſneeſing, tears and coughing, by reaſon of that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſubtile quickneſs of the ſalt, wherein lies all the power and activity of the Benjuin.</p>

                           <p>YIelds many fine preparations at once, provided the Artiſt be skilful and vigilant, and not ſparing of what is uſeful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to do it punctually and to the purpoſe; for the Chymical A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary muſt not entertain a falſe perſwaſion, as many have done, and do yet at this day, that it is enough to take the bottom and dregs of the Drugſters-box, to perform his operation withal, being a very great abſurdity to yield to this perſwaſion; conſidering, that beſides that the drugs can never give what they have not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſalt and ſpirit lies ever hidden in the pureſt part; it ſhould moreover run this hazard, that all the vertue and goodneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of might be overcome and abſorbed by the heterogenity of the impure: They then that will duly quit themſelves of their duty in the profeſſion of Spagyrical Pharmacy, muſt have as great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard in the well chuſing of their Stuffs, as if they were to work their Maſter-piece; becauſe that beſides they ſhould loſe the diſtillable matter, they would alſo trifle away their time, and ſpend it vainly with their fire and veſſels: Let this be ſaid once for all by the by, but chiefly in this place, where it is abſolutely required, that the matter we work upon be cleanly, that ſomething analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous may alſo come forth out of the ſame: for in the firſt place there will be drawn a ſpirit of wine, impregnated with a portion of the volatile, ſulphureous and ſpiritual ſalt of the Bejuin. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, There ſhall come forth the pureſt of the ſaid volatile ſalt, which will cleave to the neck of the retort: And in the third place, a fat and butyrous matter, which is nothing elſe but the groſſeſt part of the ſalt and ſulphur. Fourthly, There ſhall diſtill from it ſome ſmall quantity of Mercurial acid ſpirit. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, A little of yellow oyl of Hyacinth colour, of a very good ſmell, and finally at the giving of the laſt fire, there will come forth a Balſome ſomewhat blackiſh in colour.</p>
                           <p>To perform this ample diſtillation artificially and methodically, chuſe <abbr>lb</abbr> j. of the moſt pure and excellent Benjuin, reduce it to pouder, and put it to digeſt in a double or circulatory veſſel in the vapour of Balneo with <abbr>lb</abbr> iv. of Alcohol of Wine, during the ſpace of five natural dayes; which elapſed, pour all in a great glaſs retort; in which you ſhall put <abbr>lb</abbr> j. of pure and clean ſand, and

                              <abbr>lb</abbr>s. of ſcales of iron, ſuch as they fall from the Anvil, all theſe matters not filling above a third part of the veſſel, which muſt have a long and broad neck, and the Orifice of a Thumb-Diameter, then place it in aſhes mixt with ſand, fitting to it a middle ſiſe recipient dry and clean; the joints of which will be ſufficiently luted with plain bladder ſteeped in water, that it may be removed with more eaſe when you are obliged to change your recipient: all theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances being exactly obſerved, give the fire ſlowly by degrees, ſo as the drops may follow ſlowly on the other without heating the recipient, and having a care not to make more haſte; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you ſhould ruine all your work; for as our experienced <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Omnis praecipitatio a Diabolo:</hi> above all things then, our Artiſt muſt be patient and judicious, unleſs he will be compell'd to be ſo to his coſt and confuſion after this due warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and when he ſhall gueſs that all the ſpirit of wine is almoſt all come forth, he muſt have a particular care of encreaſing gently the fire, and taking notice when the flowers or cryſtal ſhall begin to coagulate themſelves in the neck of the retort, to change then the recipient which muſt not be luted, becauſe it muſt oft be taken of either, to take away the flowers and cryſtals which are gathered there, or to draw them with a ſtick, made for the purpoſe, from the neck of the retort, leſt they ſhould ſtop it altogether, which would cauſe the breaking of the retort, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours having no free paſſage left to come forth: when all the firſt flowers, which are the whiteſt and ſubtileſt, ſhall be drawn off, and the butyrous ſubſtance begins to appear, then muſt you again lute the retort to your recipient with a bladder, and increaſe a little the fire, that all the acid and mercurialliquor may follow the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that done, change again your Recipient, to receive the true Benjuin oyl, which will be of a yellow colour, ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling Hyacinth, but there will be but very little of it, and of a fragrant odour: the Artiſt therefore muſt take care to obſerve the change of colour: for where the drops appear red, it is the true inſtant of time to ſubſtitute a new Recipient, to receive a thick and dark Balſom by the laſt action and expreſſion of the fire. It remains only now to ſay ſomething of the uſes and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the ſeveral ſubſtances, which the Benjuin doth furniſh us with in this diſtillation: and to begin by the ſpirit, we ſay that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170969:208"/>the ſame alone, without mixture or adding any more of our gum reſin above deſcribed, may ſerve for a very excellent Coſmetick, becauſe already filled and impregnated with part of the volatile ſalt, which is properly the ſubſtance in which the deterſive, mundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and reſolutive ſtrength and faculty of the Benjuin is placed; it hath even a more penetrating vertue then the tincture, and that becauſe the tincture is laden with the unctuous body of the Benjuin, which ſtops the pores, and dryes the skin. This ſpirit is alſo more potent and capable to draw the true tincture of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juin: but not of corporeal or upprepared Benjuin, but of that which is deveſted of its ſubtile and groſs oyl, and its acid ſpirit: for you muſt take ℥ij. of the flowers cryſtals of Benjuin, and ℥s. of the butyrous matter, which muſt be put in a double or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting veſſel, pouring upon ℥ij. of the aforeſaid ſpirit, and ſo let them digeſt ſome ſpace of time together, and the ſpirit ſhall be tinged with a yellow colour, which will be nothing elſe but the extract and addition of the volatile ſalt and ſulphur graduated and exalted to the higheſt degree of their perfection: filtrate the liquor, and you ſhall find in the bottom of the veſſel, a white gum, which may be of very good uſe in perfumes. This tincture hath in a Compendium all the noble vertues of the Benjuin: the Doſis is from two drops to xij. in ſaſſafras water, Syrup of Hyſſop, or ſome Conſerve in Bolus, for all diſeaſes and griefs of the breſt above rehearſed. But as we promiſed above, that we would here exhibit the method to make Benjuin Flowers in greater quantity and leſs time, then thoſe which may be made by ſublimation in the Crucible, we will teach how to perform it; and it is only thus: Diſſolve ℥j. of the firſt butter of Benjuin, and of the whireſt, which immediately follows the cryſtals or flowers in boyling wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and filtrate very quickly the liquor through gray paper, and the flowers will inſtantly be coagulated, even under the hand: then draw back again the whitiſh water by inclination, and let it ſettle, and you ſhall have in the bottom a magiſtery of no leſs effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, then that which is made by precipitation of the Tincture, or groſs diſſolution: let the flowers dry, and the magiſtery ſlowly and leiſurely between the double paper, and keep it for uſe. The cryſtals which are properly the flowers and volatile ſalt of the Benjuin, are ſudorifick, and a great ſpecifick againſt the great
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170969:208"/>Pox, if it be given from vj. gr. to xx. in a glaſs of tincture of ſaſſafras made with white wine, or in a glaſs of decoction of <hi>ſalſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perilla, china &amp; guajacum rind.</hi> for it is a ſearcher, which in an interim penetrates the whole body; it may alſo be exhibited in a leſs Doſis, as the firſt ſublimated flowers: the oyl is an excellent vulnerary, and noble perfume. The blackiſh balſom which is clammy and viſcous, is a great Mundifier of ulcers, wherefore it may very conveniently be mixt with oyntments and plaiſters: ſome mix it amongſt <hi>Peruvian</hi> Balſom, to falſifie and encreaſe its quantity; and it is o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           <p>MAny have thought Camphire to be a bituminous ſubſtance; but they that have more truly writ concerning their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Travels in the Eaſt Country and <hi>China,</hi> do teach us, that it is a reſinous drop or gum; the beſt kind whereof comes from <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo;</hi> and that which follows in goodneſs, from the kingdom of <hi>China</hi> and the Province of <hi>Chineſeo,</hi> diſtilling from a great tree ſomewhat like unto our Wall-nut in the body or ſtock, whereof it gathers to a head. The <hi>Indian</hi> Phyſitians are not of the opinion of thoſe that fear the uſe thereof, by reaſon of the cold quality which is attributed to it; for they uſe it with very great ſucceſs, as a true divine remedy; and certainly we muſt acknowledge Camphire to be one of the moſt wonderful productions of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the neareſt of all reſembling light; for as we have often ſaid, that the volatile Salt is the laſt fold and cover that wraps the ſpirit, and that ſpirit is nothing elſe but a concretion of light, and light nothing elſe but an inviſible fire, and a true emanation of the Divinity it ſelf; ſo can we ſay, that Camphire is the only natural production, wherein the hand of nature has more excellently diſcovered one of its nobleſt operations, in ſeparating a pure, volatile, ſulphureous ſalt from a ſubſtance which ſeems to be altogether uncapable thereof; and what is more to be wondred at, is, that the skill of the moſt knowing Artiſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imitate but at a very great diſtance this natural preparation; ſince the moſt perfect maſter-pieces of their Art, are only volatile ſalts, which for the moſt part they compare to Camphire, when they think to have brought them to the higheſt piece of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but they never come near to the ſubtilty, quickneſs, tranſparency and whiteneſs of this unparallel'd mixt, nature it ſeems intending to have it ſelf alone all the glory of its perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nobleneſs and vertue: for when ever Chymical Artiſts have
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170969:210"/>endeavoured to raiſe and exalt this gum to an oyl, or ſome other analogical liquor, it has ever returned to a body again, vaniſht away, or loſt the pureſt or nobleſt part of its ſtrength or efficacy; we muſt then rather ſet here as admirers, then operarors, ſince there is nothing in this ſubſtance to be corrected, and that Camphire of it ſelf is ſufficiently pure, ſubtile and volatile, to be reduced from power into act, without vainly endeavouring by an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and proud temerity to correct a thing which God hath cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and nature produced with ſo many perfections. To prove our Aſſertion, it will be neceſſary to give here the character and notes of true Camphire, teach one of the nobleſt uſes of it, and make ſome obſervations thereupon, before we come to any of the true operations uſually made upon this noble Reſin: the Camphire then ought to be very white, tranſparent as cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal, very pure, without ſpot and mixture of any adventitious ſubſtance, of a quick and penetrating ſmell, crumbling betwixt the fingers, and almoſt not to be quenched whence once kindled, for it burns in the water it ſelf: and to diſcover the better, if it be ſophiſticated, have a Rye-loaf coming juſt from the Oven, open it, and make a hole in the middle, in which put a piece of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire of the bigneſs of a Walnut, then clap the pieces again cloſe together, and let it ſo ſtand a while warm, and this tryal will evidently make appear the truth of the ſubſtance or ſophiſticati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for if the Camphire be pure, it will all melt and vaniſh away; but if mixt with any heterogeneous matter, it will burn; or to ſpeak more properly, the Camphire will vaniſh away, and the groſs matter which did falſifie it, ſhall appear in ſubſtance whole in the bread, and as it were roaſted and dryed up: but to declare yet more evidently the volatile quality of this mixt, and its ſubtile and penetrative vertue, we muſt ſay that it is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved remedy againſt Tertian Agues, if in a knot of Taffeta you put ſome of the pureſt about the neck of the patient from ℈s. to ℈<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170969:210"/>But ſome may perhaps object, that this number of nine is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, as alſo the condition not to look in the knot, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to throw it in running water: To which we anſwer, That all theſe obſervations are neceſſary, purely phyſical and ſutable to the nature of the Remedy and diſeaſe; for though Camphire be very volatile, yet muſt there be a more violent heat then that of man to volatilize it under the ſpace of nine days: and it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite it ſhould be volatiliz'd to produce its effect, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the ſmell of the Patient, who breaths and draws it continually, by which means this volatile Salt makes an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the natural ſpirits, which drive away by degrees by a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible tranſpiration or inſenſible, or by urine, the ferment of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, and by this ſlow operation deſtroyes the action and violence thereof: As for not looking in the knot, and throwing of it into run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning water, it is an obſervation depending on a higher and more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe Philoſophy, which ſhall tell you that as the Camphire hath blotted out, and defaced the Character and Idea of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue by the irradiation of its magnetical vertue, ſo hath the ſpirit of life imprinted the Character and Idea of the diſeaſe in the knot whence the remedy did flow, and therefore muſt this Idea be removed as far as is poſſible from the formerly ſick perſon, leſt the irradiation and flowing of the ſubtile ſpirits, which do continually proceed from their bodies, may cauſe the ſaid ſpirits to be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again, and infected by the venom and contagion of the Idea of the ſickneſs, which the water carries away, and deſtroyes, and overcomes in ſuch a manner that the Patient becomes whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freed and exempted from it without any fear of Relapſe; for there is no body can be ignorant, that a Candle newly put out, can eaſily be kindled again, if another burning be brought near unto it, though kept at ſome diſtance, and not touching it with her flame; the ſame will happen to them that ſhall have the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to look into the knot, after they have removed it from their neck, and have neglected to throw it at the ſame inſtant in the running water. We might alſo find another Reaſon in the ſtrength of imagination working in the Patient; but though that may do very much, it would be needleſs, ſince we ſhall evidence hereafter, that Remedies prepared out of Camphire, work the ſame effect when taken inwardly.</p>
                           <pb n="74" facs="tcp:170969:211"/>
                           <p>We muſt come now to the neceſſary marks, for proof of what we have ſaid above: For the tryal of Camphire in new Rye-bread, and the cure of the Tertian Ague, are infallible ſigns of its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility and quick penetration, whereby it appears that thoſe that believe it to be cold, are poſſeſſed with a ſalſe and vain Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, taken from old Authors who had no skill or knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, further then what a hear-ſay could ſuggeſt them, wherein they are followed by their diſciples: But, ſay they, Camphire cannot be otherwiſe then cold, becauſe it hinders generation, and doth even hinder erection, and all other irritations neceſſary to the act of it. But ſuppoſe it to be as true as it is falſe, it doth not follow therefore that Camphire ſhould be cold: and granting that any body making a tryal thereof, and by long uſe of it both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and outwardly, that effect of impotency and barrenneſs ſhould follow in him: it would much rather be an argument of its heat, and of the ſubtile quickneſs of its volatile ſulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Salt, keeping ſtill the pores open, and continually reſolving either ſenſibly or inſenſibly the ſpirituous exhalations, which are abſolutely neceſſary to the act of generation and conception: the old <hi>Romans</hi> knew better then theſe Chimerical Philoſophers, that thoſe ſubſtances which have a quick and penetrating ſmell do ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, ſince by one of their Laws of the xii. Tables, they did forbid their Soldiers, <hi>Mentham in bello nec edere nec cedere.</hi> Is it not alſo a daily experiment, that <hi>Agnus Caſtus</hi> and Rew decreaſe the ſeed, hinder erection and the heats of luſt, by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as Camphire, though held by every body for hot remedies? which are proof more then invincible of the weakneſs of this inſipid Doctrine, which always cleaves to the appearances and outward effects of things, without reflecting and turning the edge, of their ſpeculation upon the true cauſe. Chymiſtry is only ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of this noble and diſcerning knowledge; upon which ground Chymical Phyſitians have found it expedient to make uſe of Champhire in peſtilential and malignant diſeaſes, as alſo in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, whether they adminiſter it inwardly, or apply it outwardly in Epithems and Frontals. But above all things, it is uſed with a wonderful ſucceſs in Suffocations and Fits of the Mother, if you burn ℈j. or <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſ. even to a <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. in a glaſſe of balm water, or for want of it, in plain water, by which it appears evidently, that it is the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170969:211"/>meer vertue of Camphire which produces the effect. We would not forbear to clear this truth by this our Narrative, to remove the ſcruple of thoſe who fear to make uſe of Camphire; for as I am very well perſwaded of its real vertue by experience, I thought my ſelf obliged to recommend the uſe thereof, that the publick may not be fruſtrated of the good and advantage it may receive by it. When we have ſaid, that our Artiſt could not much operate upon Camphire without deſtroying it, we have ſaid truth; for he can add nothing to its perfection, and can but waſte much of its ſubſtance, always uſeful and full of vertue: there is nevertheleſs ſome little operation neceſſary to reduce it into liquor, and mix it indiviſibly with other ſubſtances, which cannot eaſily keep it, unleſs you proceed in your work with circumſpection and method; and becauſe ſome hitherto have thought it impoſſible to reduce the ſubſtance of it into oyl, we will ſhow nevertheleſs that <hi>Labor improbus ownia vincit;</hi> but it ſhall yield but a little quantity and proportion. We will propound two examples, the one of Camphire oyl without addition of other oyl; the other with addition of two neceſſary oyls which will increaſe more and more its vertue.</p>

OF Camphire reduced to pouder, and mix it with <abbr>lb</abbr> js. of Bol. then put this mixture in a glaſſe retort, and diſtill in ſand with a well graduated fire, and the Camphire will come forth in the form of Butter. Take of this butyrous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and mix it with its double weight of Tartar very well calcinated; put this mixture in a Cucurbite, and pour upon it ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, the height of three or four fingers, and diſtill it in B.M. with all requiſite precautions. But above all things, you muſt have a carefull eye to obſerve when the Camphire ſhall begin to ſublimate: for as ſoon as you ſee it appear in the ſtill head, take away the fire, and let the veſſels cool: But the ſpirit of wine you ſhall find in the Recipient in a narrow neck bottle, and pour upon diſtilled rain-water, till you ſee the mixture of both turn as white as milk; ſo the ſpirit of Wine being weakened by the mixture of water, you ſhall perceive the Oyl of Camphire, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170969:212"/>incordorated and united to this ethereal ſpirit, to ſwim over the liquor. Continue in the ſame manner to pour ſpirit of Wine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter remaining in the Cucurbite, and diſtill with the ſame circumſpection as before, until no more of the oyl doth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate and riſe above the ſpirit of Wine and rain-water mixed. You may keep of this ſpirit of Wine impregnated with the oyl of Camphire; for it is the true Camphorated ſpirit of Wine, and not that wherein Camphire hath meerly been diſſolved. There is moſt commonly but the eight part of Camphire converted into oyl: This oyl is an excellent Remedy, for it reſiſts putrefaction and venoms; wherefore it may be exhibited in Plagues, malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant diſeaſes, and continual or intermittent Feavers: The Doſis is from one drop to ſix in ſome appropriated liquor: the campho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated ſpirit of Wine, is impregnated with the ſame vertues, but the Doſis muſt be bigger; for it may be given from ℈s. to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. inwardly; and the outward uſe is no way leſs wonderful: for the oyl and ſpirit are good to ſtop the Gangreen, &amp; appeaſe the tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, as likewiſe to allay the grief of the Gout, particularly Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atick. Note alſo, that you muſt not loſe the ſpirit of wine mixt with the ſtilled rain-water, but draw it off by diſtillation in B.M. ſince it may be uſed again, either for this ſame operation, or for ſome others: you muſt not neither loſe the ſalt of Tartar which remains in the Cucurbite, diſſolve it only with warm water, filtrate, evaporate and dry it, to uſe it to all other purpoſes as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

It is alſo a ſpecifick Remedy to reſolve and evacuate by ſeat and urine, the flime and tartarous Viſcoſities which create and cauſe pains in the joints, wherefore it may freely be given to thoſe that are ſubject to the Gout and Rheumatiſm, as thoſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe whoſe breaſt is laden with clammineſs and thick phlegms hindering the motion of the lungs: The ſpirit above all, is of ſingular uſe to free the Matrix from its impurities, as alſo to clenſe the kidneys and bladder from ſlime and ſand; the oyl is alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent to apply outwardly upon the Region of the Spleen, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſuſtain it, and reſtore to its natural ſtate, when it is grown ſchirrous and hard: It is likewiſe very efficacious to reſolve To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus'd, Hardneſſes and Calloſities of the feet and hands of ſuch as have been troubled with the Gout in thoſe parts of the body.

                     <p>WE are at laſt arrived to the laſt Chapter of our Chymical Treatiſe, which will contain the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of working, which our Artiſt is to follow as a Model and Example in any operation he will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake upon any part of the Minerals Family, the proper part and task as ſome are of opinion, of Chymiſtry. Fow although we have ſhewed how many noble Remedies this Art may extract from Animals and Vegetables, yet all that ſeems but a play in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the operations which muſt be performed, to open and diſunite what Nature hath ſo ſtrongly bound, and as it were fixed in the ſubſtances whereof Minerals do conſiſt and are compoſed. All this will better appear when we come to ſpeak of it particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly: for though in the Theorical part of this Treatiſe we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken of their generation, yet it is neceſſary that we ſhould make a ſubdiviſion of this ample and numerous Head, and declare the Subalternate genders it contains, as alſo the Species whereof they conſiſt; and that alſo we make a deſcription of their original, aſſign their definitions, and declare their conſtitutive parts, that thereby the truth and nobleneſſe of Subſtances may better be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as alſo the difficulty of their Works, which muſt needs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh and confound thoſe that pretend to the Name and Title of <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> or ſearchers of Nature, and yet are ignorant of the moſt part of her nobleſt and choiſeſt actions: For what could ſhe produce more perfect, and leſſe corruptible then Gold, more white then Pearls, more reſplendent and ſhining then Ruby and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, more wonderful then the Loadſtone, and more capable of ſurprizing and puzling the Judgement and Learning of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited and unexperienced Philoſophers, then all the ſubſtances whereof this family of Minerals is compoſed? But that which is
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170969:214"/>no leſſe ſtrange, and yet is a particular weakneſſe of ignorance, is, That theſe learned Ones are not contented to neglect the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and ſearch of Minerals, but give themſelves a liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to deſpiſe and calumniate both dead and living, who led by a noble deſire of Knowledge have applyed, and do apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſo neceſſary a work, and of ſo great advantage for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Phyſick, and think to have ſufficiently done when they advance and declare, that all theſe mineral Bodies have no correſpondence or analogy either with Man or the dſeaſes which ſeize on him, and hinder the joy of his life: But we ſhall in the ſequel of this Diſcourſe, God willing, evince the contrary, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently ſhow, that the ignorance only of the nobleſt handling of Phyſick, and their uncapacity of undertaking the work, have been the occaſion of their contradictions, which are but vain and importunate, ſince Phyſick, Pharmacy and Surgery, cannot at all be without thoſe noble Remedies that are extracted from Minerals by the operations of Chymiſtry.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>WE begin by the Earth, as being the principle of all Phyſical Generations; for it is the common Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not only of Animals and Vegetables, but it is alſo much more properly of Minerals, ſince her boſome is as it were their matrix, in the Center whereof they are bred and generated. We do not pretend to ſpeak here of Earth as it is a ſimple and pure Element, not to be conceived but intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectually; we will neither treat of it as of the Earth which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with the ſoul of the World, and which though dead of it ſelf lives nevertheleſſe with an inviſible life, which the univerſal Spirit does continually infuſe in it, to advance in her entrails the production of Minerals, in her ſurface the Vegetables, and ſupply the neceſſity of Animals which ſeem to be Maſters of all the reſt: for we have already treated of this noble and ample Matrix in the Theorical part of this Treatiſe. Wherefore we dedicate this Section to mineral Earths which are endowed with ſome phyſical Vertue, to the end to teach the Spagyrical way of the extracting of this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and ſeparating it by the operations of Chymiſtry; and even if this vertue cannot be ſeparated without alteration of its Subject, or its only eſſential Faculties, to preſerve and even encreaſe them by an addition of what may concur with the intention and anſwer to the indication of the Artiſt that intends the uſe of them. Theſe kinds of Earths have been declared by ſeveral names for three principal Reaſons: the firſt for the place of their original: the ſecond for the Matrix which has ſupplyed them and given them their colour: the third by reaſon of certain Characters or figures
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170969:215"/>impreſſed upon them. This is called the <hi>Lemniac, Maltha and Turkiſh</hi> Earth. This the golden Mine or Solar Earth, the ſilver Mine or Lunar Earth, the Venerean, Saturnine, &amp;c. and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>terra Sigillata</hi> or ſealed Earth, according to the place from whence it comes.</p>
                        <p>We ſhall not ſpeak here of the mineral Earths or mines of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, no more then of Marcaſſites, middle-Minerals, or Vitriolick and Sulphurated Earths; when we come to treat of Metalls and their original in the following Sections we ſhall be oblig'd to ſpeak thereof. Our Diſcourſe then here ſhall only be of Bolus<hi>'s</hi> and Earths ſo properly called, that what we ſhall deliver, may be as a Light and Direction to handle all other ſorts of Earths that ſhall have ſome reſemblance and analogy with theſe.</p>
                        <div type="subsection">
                           <head>Of Terra Sigillata or ſealed Earth.</head>
                           <p>BEfore we ſpeak of the chuſing of theſe Earths, and deſigne particularly the marks of their goodneſſe and Vertue, we muſt make a ſmall mental reflection upon the cauſe and reaſon of their chief Vertue. We have already ſo often ſaid, that Light is the ſpring and ſource of all good impreſſions, that we need not farther inſiſt thereon, being it is of abſolute neceſſity that this Light ſhould have tranſmitted her Rayes into the very center of theſe Earths, ſince we find in them a Cardiack, Cephalick, Hepatick, Stomachical vertue, which could not be unleſs this Earth were impregnated with ſome vitriol, or Solar, Martial or Lunary Sulphur, which are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe only embryonated in the ſame, as we will make it appear in the ſequel of this Diſcourſe; For theſe Earths being only found in ſuch places where perfect or imperfect Metals are extracted, ſo are they more or leſſe pure, more or leſſe efficatious and full of vertue, according as they partake of the purity or impurity of Vitriol and Sulphur, which are the principles of Metals found in the place of their birth and original.</p>
                           <p>The moſt excellent of all theſe Earths is that which is digged in the Iſland of <hi>Lemnos</hi> by order of the <hi>Grand Seigniour</hi> every year, and thence carried to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to be diſtributed afterwards through <hi>Europe</hi> at his pleaſure: The ſecond in order and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170969:216"/>is that which is found about the Town <hi>Striga</hi> in <hi>Sileſia,</hi> where they have begun to give it a Seal, <hi>viz.</hi> two Sols: ſome call it the fat of Gold or <hi>axungia Solis,</hi> becauſe impregnated with a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sulphur, and it is of a reddiſh colour; there is alſo a ſecond or inferiour kind which is gray or whitiſh, called alſo the fat of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or <hi>axungia Lunae,</hi> becauſe impregnated with a Lunar Sulphur. That which is Solar is dedicated to the Heart and the diſeaſes thereof, as the Lunar to the Brain and Liver. The third kind of Earth in goodneſſe is that of <hi>Blois,</hi> and all the ſorts of Earth that come nigh to it; the choice of either of them depends upon two chief notes: firſt, it muſt be apt to ſtick and cleave eaſily to the Tongue when touched by it; ſecondly, the wet or ſpittle that ſticks upon, or any other moiſt liquor, muſt immediately riſe in ſmal puſtuls or bubbles, and make a kind of ebullition, or any parcell thrown in water muſt immediately put it to a boiling; and as we ſaid that theſe earths did partake of a ſolar Vertue, by reaſon of embryonated mineral ſulphur which is in them; ſo may we alſo affirm that they are Remedies purely natural, and capable to ſhew their vertue as they come from the hands of Nature without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitating Art to contribute any help of its own: contrariwiſe, it ſhould ſeem that Art here would but injure and offend Nature, ſince theſe earths have much more vertue before the common pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration thereof pretended by vulgar Pharmacy, which are to waſh &amp; triturate them upon a Marble or Porphyry; which in effect doth nothing elſe, but take away from them that vitriolick embry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onated portion in which doth conſiſt their vertue and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. But there is a Spagyrick preparation better able to draw their pureſt and moſt efficacious ſubſtance, and thus more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly and in a leſſe Doſis it may be exhibited to Patients. The general and particular vertues of Earths and Bolus<hi>'s</hi> are to deſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and aſtringe, reſiſt putrefaction and venom, reſolve coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and congealed blood, ſtrengthen the Heart and Brain, and by ſweat purifie the maſſe of the Blood; wherefore with great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and advantage they may be given in Plague, malignant Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Diarrhea's, Dyſentery and bitings of venomous Creatures. Their external uſe is to apply upon feſtered and deſperate wounds, and to ſtop Hemorrhages or iſſues of blood.</p>

It hath no need of Rectification, for there is nothing in it but pure and uſeful. It may be us'd inſtead of the body of the Earth in all diſeaſes whereto we have ſaid above that it did conduce; but this Liquor hath one quality beſides, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary good to appeaſe the pains of running Gouts, and to correct the malignity of Itch and all other eruptions of the skin. The Doſis is from iiij. to xv. or xx. drops in Broth, Wine, or ſome other diſtilled water appropriated to the Diſeaſe. But you muſt note, that the Earth left in the Retort after diſtillation cleaves no more to the Tongue, cauſes no more ebullition when wetted with ſpittle or any other Liquor, though it keeps ſtill its ſhape and colour, which is an infallible token that its radical moiſture and internal fire which were cauſes of their aſtringence and ebulliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are paſſed into the Recipient, and that this was by conſequence the chief part of its vertue.</p>

                           <p>BOLUS is a knd of reddiſh earth, which partakes and is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated of the vapours of ſome Mines or veines of Iron, which is Mars, and participates ſomething of the ſolar nature. It is vulgarly called in ſhops <hi>Bole-Armeniack,</hi> or oriental and fine, becauſe it comes from the oriental parts of <hi>Armenia.</hi> The beſt is that which is pure, not mixt with Sand, which inſenſibly melts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as lime after it has been wetted, or like butter in the mouth is very aſtringent, and eaſily and quickly ſticks to the lips and tongue. The chief vertues of it are, ſtrongly to deſiccate and dry, to aſtringe and ſtrengthen; wherefore it is very uſeful in ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Fluxes, hindering colliquations and reſiſting putrefaction and venoms, which makes it to be employed in Diarrhea's, Lien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Dyſentery, immoderate courſes, whether white or red, ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of blood, bleeding of the Noſe and ſtopping the blood in Wounds. It may alſo be mixt in Cataplaſms, Unguents, Salves and aſtringent pouders for outward applications. Bolus may be diſtilled in the ſame manner as the ſigilled Earth and applyed to the ſame uſes. But becauſe Bolus of it ſelf is already an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Earth, we muſt teach our Artiſt how to improve and meliorate it, not by a ſeparation of its parts, but rather adding ſome Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which ſhall encreaſe its vertue, according to the Indication which may engage him to make uſe thereof; for as this Earth is dry and void of all moiſture, ſo doth it attract to its ſelf the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Salts of any Liquor mixt with much eagerneſſe, and keeps them to its ſelf till the heat of the Patients ſtomach calls them forth by making ſeparation thereof. We will deliver four ſeveral deſcriptions, that upon the model of it others may be prepared. The firſt ſhall be to make it more aſtringent, and capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing its effect ſooner and more ſafely in outward applications. The ſecond, to render it more efficacious for diſſolving congealed and coagulated blood in the body, whereby to corroborate Nature, and help it to expel and evacuate that blood ſo diſſolved, either by Sweat or Urine. The third will encreaſe its aſtringency for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward applications, to make it ſooner ſtop the Fluxes and looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170969:217"/>of the Belly, Dyſentery and immoderate Courſes. The fourth will render it more fit to produce very remarkable effects in peſtilential diſeaſes and all malignant Feavers, where ſtrength doth fail by the ſharpneſſe and abundance of the venom, which of neceſſity muſt be brought to tranſpiration, and expelled from the center of the Patients body to the circumference and outward parts by the help of this prepared earth, which retains in it ſelf the beſt, ſubtileſt and pureſt of the liquor wherewith it has been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>BEfore we deliver the definition of Stones, and deſcribe the operations performed upon ſome of them, we have thought it not unfit to ſpeak ſomething of the eſſence or mineral Spirit which rules in the Earth, in whoſe boſome it begins and ends the generation both of ſtones and of all other mineral Bodies. Now this eſſence or Spirit is void of action, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs aſſiſted by the water which is to it inſtead of a Vehicle, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey and carry it in its ſoft and fluid body into the very bowels of the Earth. This mineral eſſence ſeemes to be nothing elſe but the univerſal ſpirit of the Spirit of the World, impregnated by the light of all the mineral Ideas, which it doth impreſs and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to the water, that ſhe may be capable to produce the fruits of the mineral Kingdom in the ſeveral matrixes of the earth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Genus and ſpecies of this eſſence, differing in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, though one and the ſame in eſſence: for according as it is metalline, petrifying, ſaline, bituminous and earthly, it produces the variety of ſubſtances depending of each of theſe ſubalternate genders, and according to the predominant character and Idea, the mineral ſubſtances are pure or impure, fix or volatile, and ſo of all the other proprieties and faculties of theſe Mixts.</p>
                        <p>This being ſo, it is not difficult to conceive that ſtones in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170969:219"/>are nothing elſe but terreſtrial hard bodies, not ductile, apt to crumble, and coagulated by the power and ſtrength of the Lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difick Ferment: We have hinted above the difference and variety of ſtones: there remains no more to do at preſent, but to chuſe thoſe we intend to give for an example &amp; pattern of the operations which generally may be performed upon all others. We will then ſelect for the ſubjects of ſuch preparations as may be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtones, Firſt the <hi>Emerald;</hi> ſecondly the <hi>Chryſtal;</hi> thirdly the <hi>Coral;</hi> fourthly <hi>Lapis Judaicus;</hi> fifthly <hi>Chalk,</hi> and finally the Limeſtone. But as there are general obſervations which may be given for all ſtones in general, we muſt ſpeak ſomething thereof, becauſe it will much help our Artiſt to facilitate and explain the meaning of all what we ſhall hereafter ſay, not only of ſtones, but alſo of all other Minerals and of Metals themſelves. They that will have a very exact knowledge of ſtones, may have recourſe to that learned Book which <hi>Boetius Van Bood,</hi> Phyſitian to the Emperor <hi>Rudolphus</hi> II. hath writ, and he ſhall fully be ſatisfied as touching this matter: for our intent is only to anatomize here thoſe we have named; becauſe they will be ſufficient to inſtruct the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Apothecary how to work upon all others that have a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or conformity to them.</p>
                        <p>Firſt then we ſay, that our Artiſt muſt conſider, that as the body of precious or not precious ſtones is harder and more fix then that of Animals and Vegetables; ſo muſt he go to work and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in another way in their anatomy, and uſe different Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum's to extract and diſſolve them: and moreover, that theſe Menſtruums ſhall not act for the moſt part upon ſuch fix and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid bodies as theſe are, unleſs they be calcined beforehand, either by themſelves or mixed with Salt or Brimſtone, to penetrate the hardneſſe and compactneſs of their bodies, and render them po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ſo as the liquors which ſhall be uſed in their extraction or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, may more eaſily and uſefully perform their action upon them. <hi>Calcination</hi> is one of the principal operations made upon ſtone, either to make them fit for Medicinal uſes, or to open them and render them capable of the moſt exact Chymical ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. This diſpoſitive or preparatory Calcination is threefold: for it is either meer ignition, as when common Lime is burned; ſecondly, ignition with an extinction of the matter in ſome Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170969:220"/>to diſunite it by this reiterated action, and ſo reduce it into Pouder or Calx. The third Calcination is performed with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſalt, Saltpeter or Brimſtone. <hi>Solution</hi> follows Calcination, and is made with ſeveral different Menſtruum's, according to the greater or leſſe fixity found in the diſſoluble Bodies; the chief and moſt uſually employed are Vinegar, either ſimply diſtilled, or alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, the ſpirit of therebinthinated Vinegar, and the vinegar of Honey, ſpirit of Vitriol and of Salt, and oyle of Sulphur or Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone made <hi>per Campanam;</hi> but the ſpirit of <hi>Venus</hi> goeth in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and activity beyond all the foreſaid Menſtruum's, to extract or diſſolve all manner of calcined or uncalcined ſtones; we will ſhew the preparation of it in the Section of Metals. After diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution follows <hi>coagulation,</hi> which is performed two wayes: either drawing of the Menſtruum by evaporation or by diſtillation, and then what remains is a ſalt; or elſe it is made by precipitation, and the remaining pouder is properly called <hi>a Magiſtery.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is beſides <hi>Edulcoration</hi> and putrification made by abluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſolutions and coagulations often repeated: and for the laſt operation, <hi>liquation</hi> or ſolution of the ſalts which have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the ſtones, in a Liquor commonly called <hi>Oleum per deliquium,</hi> or oyl of Deficiency; it is made in ſome moiſt place upom ſome Table or ſquare of Marble or Glaſs; and the Crown and perfection of all the work, is the volatization of the liquor or ſalt of a ſtone by the help of ſome good Cordial Menſtruum, which is not to be performed but by digeſtion and reiterated diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; for in every one of theſe operations, there aſcends ſtill a portion of ſalt with the Menſtruum; and if the Menſtruum be left impregnated with this ſalt, it is called the <hi>Elixir</hi> of the ſtone: but if it be drawn off with a ſoft and gentle heat, that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the bottom of the Veſſel in the form of an oyl is called <hi>the eſſence</hi> of the ſtone.</p>
                        <p>Thus by this gradation of operations ſtones are converted into Salts, Magiſtery, Liquor, Elixir and Eſſence: But before we put an end to theſe general hints, we will give a general proceſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all kind of ſtones, to reduce them into Salt and Eſſence with leſſe work and leſſe toyl, which is performed in the following manner.</p>
                        <p>Reduce to an impalpable pouder ſuch kind of ſtone as you ſhall
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170969:220"/>think fit to take by one of the three Calcinations we have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned above, then grind this ſubtil pouder on a Porphyry ſtone of a Sea-ſhell, with equal weight of Bay or Seaſalt well dryed; put that mixture in a Crucible, which you ſhall cover and lute exactly: the Lute being dry, put it in a Potters-furnace at the ſame time as he begins to bake his pots, and there let it ſtand twenty four hours: after which take out your Veſſel and open it, and the matter which you ſhal find in it, diſſolve with warm diſtilled rain-water in a glaſed earthen pan; ſtir and triturate it nimbly with a Glaſs or wooden peſtle; pour the diſſolution in another pan alſo glaſed, and thus proceed grinding; ſtirring and diſſolving in new warm water, until the Calx of the ſtone remains indiſſoluble in the bottom: then dry it and reiterate the ſame operation with dryed ſalt, until all the body of the Calx be reduced and converted into a ſlimy fat and glewing ſubſtance among the body of the warm water: then being ſetled again, ſeparate the clear water which ſwims above the ſlimy grounds of ſetlement by inclination; and put all theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in a glaſs Cucurbite in ſand; give it a competent fire, and draw off by evaporation or diſtillation the half part thereof: then pour upon the liquor remaining in the Cucurbite oyle of Tartar drawn by deficiency or <hi>per deliquium,</hi> drop by drop until this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor becomes as white as milk; then filter this white water, to ſeparate the part thereof which you ſhall find precipitated; and thus continue to precipitate and filtrate until the water remaines clear. Then put together all the ſlimy parts remaining in the bottom of the Pans with that which is in the Filter, and waſh it with pure lukewarm Fountain water, until the water comes our as void of taſte as when it was poured on, which will be a ſure token that the remaining matter is deſtitute of all ſaltiſhneſſe; then ſeparate the water thereof with as much exactneſſe and care as you can, and put this matter in a Cucurbite, pouring upon it very good diſtilled Vinegar four fingers high; put all in aſhes to digeſt, until the Vinegar hath loſt its ſharpneſs and is become ſweet; then draw it off by inclination, and pour freſh Vinegar theron at the ſame height, and thus proceed &amp;, go on, until the diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Vinegar changes no more its taſte: then joyn all theſe extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſſolutions, filtrate and evaporate in ſand ſlowly without boyling until all be dry, and you ſhall have the ſalt of the ſtone
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170969:221"/>of a grayiſh colour, which grind and put in a Matraſs, and pour upon tartarizated ſpirit of Wine the height of four fingers: ſtop your Veſſel with a Blindhead and extract the Tincture thereof in <hi>B. M.</hi> and when the Spirit ſhall appear coloured, ſeparate it and ſupply with new until it takes no more colour; then filtrate all the Tinctures, and draw off ſoftly the ſpirit in a vaporous Balneo, until the eſſence of the ſtone remaines in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom in the conſiſtency of a clear Syrup. This is the general method of working upon ſtones of what vertue or quality ſoever: and whenſoever our Artſt hath made any Eſſence of this kind, he ſhall repair to ſuch Authors as have particularly treated of that ſtone and of its vertues, and ſo ſhall be capable to apply them to their right uſe. We may only add the genetal Doſis of theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Remedies, which is from j. or ij. drops to viij. or x. in the morning faſting, in Broth, Wine, Decoction, or ſome diſtilled water ſpecifick and appropriated to the Diſeaſe and Remedy; and let this be ſaid in the way concerning ſtones in general; we come now to the particular operations which we propound for a Pattern and Model in particular.</p>

                           <p>THE <hi>Emerald</hi> is a precious ſtone, tranſparent and very fair by reaſon of its pleaſant green colour, the ſofteſt and moſt brickle of all others. The beſt <hi>Emeralds</hi> are the Oriental, both in regard their green is deeper and more pleaſant to the eye, and becauſe they are of greater vertue; the meaneſt are thoſe which are brought from <hi>Peru</hi> and found in <hi>Europe.</hi> After that the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Emerald</hi> have been purely calcin'd by ignition and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction in water of juice of Bugloſs, and then triturated or ground to an Alkohol upon the Porphyry ſtone with the ſame wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and dryed, it may be adminiſtred in Bolus or Pill, with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Marigold flower from iiij. <hi>gr.</hi> to x. againſt all manner of Lasks of the Belly and bloody Fluxes: but chiefly againſt Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery, either proceeding from eroſion of the Entrals, or from ſome malignant matter: it is alſo a fit Remedy againſt the biting of venomous Creatures, Plague, peſtilential Feavers and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170969:221"/>that partake of malignancy. There are many other noble vertues attributed to the <hi>Emerald</hi> being whole and unprepared: but they only reſpect outward application, ſuch as to hang it on the neck againſt the Falling-fickneſſe; Tye it to the Thigh for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing delivery in Childbed; apply it on the belly to prevent miſcarrying, ſtop the bleeding of the Noſe with keeping it in the mouth; as likewiſe bloody Fluxe, and Emrods applyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lungs: it is alſo ſaid to recreate both outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes worn on the finger, and to expel fear and terrour of ill Viſions. There are ſome Authors who deliver as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, it will oftentimes break being worn by too la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcivious a perſon, and who unboundedly will abandon himſelf to Venery. So much have we thought fit ſummarily to ſay, that it may appear what experience hath found out towards the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of precious ſtones, which have all in themſelves ſome por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of very pure metallick Sulphur, which communicates Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Faculties unto them of much more extent then that of Animals and Vegetables. And what is this Sulphur elſe but the pureſt part of condenſed light? which yields a continual irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of its vertue without any leſſening or diminution, by reaſon of the magnetical vertue of the ſtone, which perpetually attracts its like from the uppermoſt Heaven; as it appears yet better by the <hi>oriental Saphire,</hi> and the efficacy is wonderful againſt the Plague, inſomuch as if the Patient hath many boiles or ſores on his body at once, none of them will break or run, but that about which a circle or ring hath been made with a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire touching the skin: and moreover, the ſcarification ſhall never ſurpaſſe the bounds, which the vertue of the ſtone ſeems to have preſcribed ann limited unto it. But let us come to the Chymical preparation, by which the ſalt Tincture and Elixir or Eſſence are extracted.</p>

For beſides this Centrical and luminous Sulphur whence all theſe noble vertues are derived, there remains beſides in this <hi>Elixir</hi> a certain portion of the volatile ſalt of Urine, which cleaves to this Sulphur by the help of the ſpirit of Wine, framing together an eſſence capable of all theſe vertues which we have attributed unto it.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170969:222"/>and a little proportion of water, which by help of the ſalt it had in it ſelf, impregnared with the petrifying Idea and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hath diſſolved the ſaid earth.

M. the ſpace of two natural days with a moderate heat, and in the end you ſhall find the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tinged with a very high blood-red colour; open the veſſels, and filtrate the liquor, and put it in a Cucurbite in B.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170969:224"/>all the liquor till the grounds remain dry; which take afterwards, and put on a Matble-ſtone in a cold cellar, or ſome other moiſt place to reſolve them into a red liquor, which you are to receive in a glaſs cup or doſis, co-operating ſtill carefully, whether the drops as they fall be red, becauſe the eſſence of the chryſtal is only in them which hold forth that colour; for when the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour alters, it is a manifeſt ſign that the fixed ſalt of the Salt-Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſſolves it ſelf; wherefore you muſt keep apart the firſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, without much heeding the other: let this red liquor ſettle during ſome days, and draw by inclination the pure part from the impure, which preſerve in a ſtrong vial; and when you will uſe it, take ℥j. thereof, and mix it with another ounce of good white Wine in a Vial, and ſhake it together; then let it ſettle the ſpace of twenty four hours and there will be yet a new defeca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; pour the clear and red thereof not ſtirred in three pound of white wine, to which this liquor will cleave without leaving or ſeparating any impurity; this mixture muſt be adminiſtred three times a day to ſuch as are tormented with the ſtone, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel or nephritical Fits, and thoſe alſo which have already ſome diſpoſition towards the gout, and find any weakneſs or impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their limbs: but chiefly to thoſe which are troubled with Tophus's and Hardneſſes, by reaſon of the Tartar coagulated towards the extremities. The doſis is ℥ iv. or ℥ v. in a glaſs, the firſt time in the morning faſting, the ſecond two or three hours after twelve, and the third about bed-time: The uſe of it muſt not be intermitted during the ſpace of a philoſophical month, which is forty days, to perfect the recovery; and if during this interval the belly doth not perform its office, take no purging me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, but it will ſuffice if every other day the Patient takes a plain Glyſter of freſh ſtale, or urine without any addition to it, and the next day ℈ j. of the liquor of ☿ of <hi>Sennertus</hi> in chicken or veal broth, where you have boiled Parſley and Scorzonera roots.

                           <p>WEE put Coral and its peparation in the rank of ſtones, as much by reaſon of the analogy of its ſtony ſubſtance, as becauſe the operations which are made upon it have a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance with thoſe performed upon ſtones, both in reſpect of the manner of working, and the Menſtruum's which Artiſts do uſe both to diſſolve and to extract it. The work we ſhall teach here upon Coral may be a pattern for Pearls, all kind of ſtones proceeding from Animals, and from ſhells: for it would but prove tedious to repeat ſo often the ſame thing, ſince both the manner of working and Menſtruum's are like in the one and the other.</p>
                           <p>We ſhall not loſe time here in frivolous debates about the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ancient and modern Writers concerning the generation of Coral, to know whether it was Plant-like, of a ſoft or hard branch before extracted out of the Sea, becauſe all this makes little for our purpoſe, it will ſuffice if we can but in a gueſſe ſay moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly what it is, delivering the differences and teaching the choice thereof, and principally how it is beſt reduced into uſefull Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                           <p>Coral is nothing elſe but a ſtrong ſhrub found growing upon ſtones in the bottom of the Sea. There are ſeveral differences of it by reaſon of the variety of colours, and the more or leſſe compactedneſs and hardneſs of its ſubſtance; but waving all other kinds, we purpoſe only to treat here of red Coral, which muſt be of a cloſe ſubſtance compacted, dry and hard, high in colour, pure and clean, ſuch having more vertue, and poſſeſſing in it as in a compendium all the efficacy and eſſential faculties, which the other kinds may be endowed with. But here ſome body might move a queſtion, Why red is preferable to all the reſt? to which the anſwer is not difficult, ſince this redneſs is an external ſigne of the intrinſecal vertue of the mineral Sulphur, which is one of the principles of Coral, and from which are derived the chief vertues of it being of a Solar nature; which is the cauſe alſo that all Artiſts have at all times ſought with great ſtudy, care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170969:225"/>the way how to extract the true Tincture of Coral, being one of the chief Remedies which Chymical Phyſick doth afford; for if any thinks to be capable of giving a reaſon for this redneſs by the firſt and ſecond qualities of ſubſtances, certainly he will fall ſhort of his purpoſe, ſince we can aſſign no better reaſon then the Will of the Almighty Creator, who hath imparted to things ſuch colours as he hath been pleaſed with, and hath ſo wiſely implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in their ſeminaries, that their internal <hi>archeus</hi> or natural and innate Architectonical ſpirit can never ſwerve from them nor forſake them but by Errour or uncapacity and unfitneſs of the matter, the ordinary cauſes of generation of Monſters, which very unjuſtly are attributed to an errour and blemiſh of Nature.</p>

                           <p>AS Coral poſſeſſes many ſingular and noble vertues, ſo have our Artiſts in all times ſought the poſſible wayes of opening its body with great variety of Menſtruum's, to extract from the center of this mixt the noble Remedies which Nature hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in it. I can even ſay that there is no natural product upon which ſo many, either vegetable or mineral Liquors have been tryed; and to prove the truth of this Aſſertion I ſhall only here rehearſe ſome of the principal, which are all manner of diſtilled Vinegars, Juices of Berberries, Lemon, Quinces, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range, ſpirit of dew and Honey, acid or ſharp ſpirit of Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, the liquor or Birch-tree, the ſpirits of <hi>Guajacum,</hi> Box, Juniper, tops of Alder and Service-tree; ſpirits of Tartar, Salt, Vitriol, Sulphur or Brimſtone, the tempered ſpirit of Wine acuated with thoſe ſalts, the burning ſpirit of Coral it ſelf, the vinegar or acid Spirit of the ſame, and finally the ſpirit and phlegm of <hi>Saturn;</hi> but above all, the moſt active and efficacious is the ſpirit of <hi>Venus.</hi> whereof we have already ſpoken ſomewhere elſe, and will give a deſcription in the Section of Metals.</p>
                           <p>I have not thought it out of purpoſe to intimate the variety of theſe Menſtruum's, to make it appear more evidently how many operations have been begun and finiſht upon Coral; and that when the Chymical Apothecary ſhall conſult any of the Authors that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170969:225"/>have treated or it, and finding ſo great a difference ſhall doubt to which part he may beſt and more ſafely incline, he may have a guide herein and be conducted through this Labyrinth by the thred of Experience which we our ſelves have made thereof. Wherefore we will give examples how to extract in the beſt manner the ſalt of Coral and falſe Magiſtery; then how to make the true which ought to be diſſoluble; and in the third place we will give the method of extracting the Tincture thereof, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally how the true Syrup is to be made, and that he may have a true and full Idea of the vertues of Coral, and affix it to one of theſe four Remedies, according to their corporeity, ſpirituality and their Doſis. We have thought fit to prefix the general and particular vertues, which both Ancient and Modern Writers have attributed to Coral, which are theſe: The general vertues are to be aſtringent, cool and dry, ſtrengthen and corroborate the heart, ventricle, liver, and purifie the maſſe of the blood, whence it is given againſt the Plague, venoms and malignant Feavers. It chears up the internal ſenſes, as alſo the external; ſtops all kind of Fluxes of the Belly, Womb and privy parts. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſaith, That Coral of a high colour worn about the body as a preſervative, frees the party from fear of Witchcraft, Incantation, Poyſon, Epilepſie, Melancholy, danger of evil Spirits, or touch of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

                           <head>How to prepare rightly the ſalt of Coral.</head>
                           <p>TAke as much well choſen red Coral as you will, dry, hard, and of a high-coloured red; beat it in a brazen Mortar well cleanſed with its Peſtle to a courſe pouder, and thereof put ℥ iiij. in a Matraſs, and gently pour upon ſtrong and pure diſtilled Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar: I ſay gently and by degrees, becauſe if it were poured too much at a time, there would immediatly ariſe a ſudden ebullition by the action of the Diſſolvent upon the diſſoluble Body, and ſo part of the diſſolution ſhould run danger to be caſt away; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt you act with prudence and patience until the violent action of the Spirit be allayed, then may you continue boldly your pouring of the Vinegar all at once to the height of four fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170969:226"/>and having placed your Matraſs in aſhes or ſand, ſtir it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten until the Vinegar ſhows no more action or is grown altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſipid, which is then a clear teſtimony that all its ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is loſt by the action it has upon the ſubſtance of the Coral; after this draw by inclination this Spirit ſo impregnated of the Coralline ſalt, and pour on freſh to continue your extraction: and thus digeſt, extract, and draw off until no more of the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble ſubſtance of the Coral be left; then filtrate all the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being cold, becauſe if you did it whilſt they be warm, the heat would make ſome ſmall terreſtrial corpuſcles to penetrate through the Filtre, which would hinder the purity and Diſſolubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ſalt; all theſe diſſolutions being filtrated, put them in a Cucurbite in Sand, and draw off the moiſtneſſe with a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heat until a white Ring appears about the Veſſel: then ceaſe the fire, for this is a ſign that the Liquor is too much loaden; touch not the Veſſel till all be cold, becauſe it would hinder the chryſtallization of the ſalt which makes it more eaſie to diſſolve and more pleaſant to ſight; the remaining Liquor ſeparate by inclination to continue the evaporation of it in a Diſh till in the bottom appears a dry ſalt, but it will never be ſo fine nor ſo good as the firſt. But it may be objected, that the evaporation of the Menſtruum could ſooner be performed in Diſhes or an earthen Pan then in a Cucurbite covered with its Still-head; which I grant, but deny that it could be ſo cleanly done: for it would be impoſſible for the Artiſt to hinder the duſt of the coals which muſt continually be ſtirred in a Laboratory from ſpoiling and defiling the Salt; and above all things cleanlineſs in Chymical operations is to be ſtudied. There is nevertheleſſe another Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Philoſophical Reaſon which may oblige him to draw off the Menſtruum in a Blindhead covered with its Still, <hi>viz.</hi> That he may know by this way when the ſpirit of Vinegar ſhall be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether changed, and that which drops down becomes altogether inſipid and as void of ſalt as Rain-water; moreover, this water which he draws off is not uſeleſſe, ſince it is much better then many other diſtilled Waters to make Juleps thereof in burning Feavers: For in this Water remains hidden a Spirit imperceptible to the taſte, but very ſubtil and capable of doing much good to ſick perſons: ſecondly, the ſalt of Coral will be finer and purer,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170969:226"/>and likewiſe of more vertue, becauſe by this ſlow diſtillation it gets more ſubtility and refinedneſſe, which becomes more capable of producing its efficacy.</p>
                           <p>Here we muſt reſolve a difficulty of great importance; which is, that almoſt all the Authors which have treated of the Practice of Chymiſtry do preſcribe, that after the ſalt of Coral and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have been prepared and drawn with diſtilled Vinegar, they ſhould be dulcorated by ſeveral diſſolutions and evaporations, leaſt the ſharpneſſe remaining in thoſe Salts be hurtful and of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the bodies of ſick Patients, wherein to ſpeak truth, they are much deceived and are to be blamed: for that ſalt which they pretend to take away is abſolutely neceſſary; and I am bold to ſay, that even in caſe they could remove and waſh it off by this way which they propound, that, what ſhould remain, would abſolutely be uſeleſſe, not to ſay hurtful. For as Vinegar is but a fixed Wine by the predominancy of a Tartarous acid Salt over the ſulphureous volatile ſpirit of the Wine, we muſt acknowledge that it is nothing elſe but a liquid Tartar, yet involved in many impurities: but the Vinegar being diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it turns to a liquid Tartar more refined and more ſubtilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which can have no more of danger in it then the <hi>Cremor Tartari,</hi> unleſſe it were by reaſon of its phlegm. Now after this Spirit has diſſolved the Coral, and that the Artiſt draws off this phlegm, the ſubtil Tartar of the fixed Wine joyns and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporates with the Coral, and frames that which is called <hi>Salt of Coral,</hi> whoſe only vertue proceeds from the union of this vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliz'd Tartar joyned with the Coral, becauſe it is this Salt which conveys the Coral into the laſt digeſtions of the body, and drives away the ſenſible and inſenſible tranſpiration, and by Urines all the peccant humours and impurities againſt Nature harbouring in the Maſſe of the blood. But for a clearer proof we will ſet this truth before your eyes in the immediatly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Preparation.</p>

                           <p>YOU muſt diſſolve the Coral in diſtilled Vinegar, in the ſame manner as we have preſcribed for the extraction of the Salt, and filtrate the diſſolution, out of which draw back again the two third parts of the menſtruum by diſtillation, and the Veſſels being cooled, ſet the remaining liquor in a Glaſs or white earthen diſh, and pour upon drop by drop diſſolved ſalt of Tartar, which impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is called <hi>Oleum</hi> ☿ <hi>per deliquium;</hi> and you ſhall find a white coagulation, which is nothing elſe but the earthly and ſtony ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Coral returned to a body which leaves and forſakes its diſſolvent, which is this ſharp ſalt of Vinegar. Now all the lixivial ſalts which are made by Calcination do kill the ſharp ones, which cauſes the diſſolvent to quit the Body which it had diſſolved, and ſo it is reſtored to its ſelf again and precipitated wanting that ſubtil Salt which did render it viſible in the Liquor; after this pour what ſwims above this white ſubſtance, and put clear water upon to edulcorate it, and ſo continue doing till the water comes off as taſteleſs and inſipid as when it was poured on; then dry gently this white ſubſtance, and you ſhall have that which is pretended to be Magiſtery of Coral, which is (to ſay the truth) nothing elſe but a fixed and aſtringent earth, much worſe and leſs ſafe then plain Coral prepared, or purely reduced to a very ſubtil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

But this pretended Magiſtery can never be well uſed in ſuch a caſe, becauſe it is fixt, and the diſtilled Vinegar, or even corroſive Spirits can have no action upon it: by which it appears that it is unſufficient and uncapable to deſtroy or alter that ſharpneſs agarnſt Nature, by which the looſneſs of the belly and relaxation or weakneſs of ſtomach is wrought, and therefore it is altogether unprofitable in the uſe of Phyſick. But it will perhaps be urged again, that it may alſo be precipitated without ſpirit of Vitriol with its own oyle, or oyle of Sulphur, or ſpirit of Salt, and that it will thus be mended and exalted, which we deny again; for, were there any good to be expected from theſe Magiſteries, it would be from that which is precipitated with liquor of ☿ rather then with theſe Spirits, becauſe it would yet be more fixed then the other, and ſo conſequently leſs capable of action.

                           <p>THere is nothing ſo common in the Mouths and Writings of Chymical Artiſts as Tincture of Coral, and ſcarce any that hath medled with the Art, but pretends to have the ſureſt proceſſe and way of making it, and moreover to have wrought miracles therewith; but there is a vaſt difference between words and deeds: for it is eaſie to ſpeak boaſtingly, but hard to prove this truth by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. Now as all Authors, but chiefly <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> do attribute to this Remedy extraordinary Vertues, ſo is it very fitting to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared againſt the Deluſions and ſurpriſal of thoſe who pretend to the Art of making of it, and who keep it as a particular knowledge and ſelect to themſelves, being not willing to impart ſo much as the manner of their preparation and extraction, much leſs the matter out of which they take their Menſtruum, whereof they make uſe in the drawing of this Tincture. The truth is, it is not without grounds we may ſuſpect their capacity; for they that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170969:229"/>boaſt themſelves with the knowledge of making this Tincture, are oftentimes altogether ignorant what Tincture is, or what Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum. Let then all thoſe that will atrain to the truth of it know, that the greateſt part of theſe pretended Tinctures, are nothing elſe but diſſolutions of the body of Coral if it be whole and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out previous Calcination; or the only exaltation and rubifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Menſtruum employed about the Coral calcined by a ſimple Reverberation, or with addition of ſome ſalts; for calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and Reverberated ſalts communicate themſelves to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors uſed for Extraction, and ſo do exalt and colour with red the volatile ſalt of the Menſtruum, by which the moſt part of thoſe which hitherto have believed to have made the true Tincture of Coral are deceived; But the truth is eaſily diſcovered by preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitating or evaporating of the ſame; for by theſe two actions the ſalt or body of the Coral is diſcovered, which was before inviſibly diſperſed through the Menſtruum. Now the Tincture of Coral muſt be free from all theſe miſtakes; it muſt be pure, it muſt be ſimple, not loaded with any other ſubſtance or body, becauſe the internal ſulphurs of things have a great irradiation and large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in their vertue, but ſcarce are comprehenſible and brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſenſes by their corporeity. Moreover, the firſt or ſecond Menſtruum's which are employ'd, muſt not be capable of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to contract any colour, though long kept in digeſtion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out addition of any other mixture. Our Artiſt being ſure and well reſolved in all theſe particulars, if with theſe precautions he draws any Tincture from Coral, he may be very confident it is true, and that it ſhall produce thoſe effects which Authors do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute unto it. I can give no better nor more Philoſophical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription thereof then that which follows.</p>

Separate from the diſtilled Liquor the oyle of Tartar by filtration, and rectifie the Spirit on aſhes to a dry bottom, and ſo ſhall you have the firſt Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum to extract Corals without any previous Calcination.

                           <head>To make the Tincture of Coral thus.</head>
                           <p>℞ As much of the faireſt and reddeſt Coral you can meet with, and reduce it cleanly to a very ſubtile pouder, which put in a Matraſs and pour upon of the firſt Menſtruum about ℥ j. or ij. at once, ſtirring it nimbly, then begin again to pour freſh Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum, and ſtir until your matter be covered with it the height of four inches; ſtop your Veſſel with a Blindhead, and put to digeſt in a vaporous Bath in ſhred ſtraw during the ſpace of three weeks, with a heat a little more then lukewarm, after this open the Veſſels, draw off the red Tincture by inclination, and keep in a Vial; then reaffund new Menſtruum upon the remaining body of the Coral, and continue the digeſtion and extraction untill the Menſtruum takes no more of the colour: then join all the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and filtrate them, and having put them in a Cucurbite on ſand draw off the liquor to a dry bottom in a moderate heat, and you ſhall find in the bottom of the Glaſs a red pouder, which hides in its center the internal ſulphur of the Coral, which conſtitutes
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170969:230"/>its colour and vertue: put this pouder in a circulatory Veſſel called <hi>a Pelican,</hi> and pour upon it of the ſecond Menſtruum cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>temperate water</hi> the height of vj. fingers; lute exactly the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per orifice of the Veſſel; after you have ſtopt it with a Glaſs-ſtople, place it in Balneo and keep in digeſtion during the ſpace of one Philoſophical Moneth, and this ſweet and pleaſant Menſtruum will draw to its ſelf this wonderful Sulphur, and take a very pleaſant colour. This done, ceaſe the fire, open the veſſel and filtrate the Tincture, to ſeparate the feculency and ſediment which remains in the bottom of the Pelican; put then the filtration in a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbite, and draw off the two thirds or half of the Menſtruum, and keep choicely the remainder, as one of the principal Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of a Spagyrical ſhop. Let not our Artiſt preſume to cut off any part, or ſhorten the ſpace of forty dayes, though he perceives his Menſtruum to be tincted: for the circulation muſt perform the extraction, exaltation and union, which operations do require no leſs time; for the Chymical Apothecary which deſires to be ſucceſsful in his work, ought to follow the motion of Nature which works nothing but ſlowly, and muſt ever have in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance the ſaying of our great Maſter <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> that <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis praecipitatio à Diabolo;</hi> and that he that doth well, hath ever done ſoon enough.</p>
                           <p>But before we preſcribe the Doſis and vertues of this Tincture, we muſt ſatisfie Mens minds, that it is not only good in opinion and fancy, but in reality. To this end let us make a judicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection both upon the matter and the Menſtruum's. There is no body but knows and confeſſes that Coral hath many ſingular noble vertues, ſo that both ancient and modern Authors have all una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly acknowledged, that this vertue reſided in its redneſs, and have all ſtroven to finde out ſome liquor analogous to our Nature wherewith to extract it. This is plain in our proceſſe; for the Ingredients we employ for the diſtillation of the firſt Menſtruum, are good and harmleſs each of them aſunder; but beſides there is a myſtical and philoſophical union made of them by the diſtillation and digeſtion that hath been previous, ſo that the ſharpneſs of the Vitriol hath been moderated and ſweetened by the Tartar, and by their action and reaction each upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and thus of this match doth reſult a Spirit friendly to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170969:231"/>and free from corroſiveneſs, which may take away all fear that it might have altered the ſeminal principles of Coral: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, it only has freed them from the commerce of the matter whereby they were fettered, and rather exalted them to a perfection then debaſed their worth. As for the ſecond Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum, I believe there is no body will take upon him to ſay ought againſt it, ſince the ſpirit of Wine and that of Salt are two real conſervative Balſom's, not only of living bodies but even of dead ones, while they are yet aſunder: But who ſhall not admire the wonderful ſecrets of Art and Nature, capable to make an union of the ſubtileſt and moſt volatile of all Spirits, with one of the moſt fix, and thereof make a neutral and middle compound, which hath nothing left either of the taſte, or any other quality of the two taken aſunder! ſo that I conclude that this Tincture cannot be but one of the moſt excellent Remedies which Chymiſtry can afford, and therefore hath it this prerogative to be one of the firſt and principal of all Remedies to purifie the maſſe of the blood from all the impurities by which it may be tainted: either Leproſie, Venerean Pox, or Scorbute; it ſtrengthens the Heart, chears the Senſes, drives away Melancholy, hinders ſad Dreams, ſtops Hemorrhagies, allayes inward pains, ſtrengthens the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, appeaſes the irritation of the Mother, corrects <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Tincture may be uſed by the way of a preſervative morning and evening in old

The Doſis from j. drop to iiij. and for the cure of Diſeaſes, it muſt be given to the ſick in ordinary or Chronical Diſeaſes from j. drop to x. in Menſtruum analogical and proportionate to the Diſeaſe, and that during the ſpace of forty dayes, becauſe that interval is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to renew and repair the whole Body in the moſt obſtinate Diſeaſes, and ſo proportionally under that time according to the exigency of the diſtemper and malady; therefore we muſt leave it to the judgement of the Phyſitian; but becauſe all are not capable of preparing this Remedy, and knowing the Genius of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be too impatient to allow themſelves the requiſite time whereby they may poſſeſs the Tinctures and Arcana's: I have thought it fitting to join and teach here the manner of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Syrup of Coral, by a quick and eaſie way, and which may be made uſe of inſtead of this Tincture; but with much difference of vertue; and I know not whether Apothecaries will take the pains and be at the neceſſary charge of the confection of this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup, though to ſpeak truth, it may prove the beſt piece of their furniture; yet I have ſome hopes that thoſe that are careful and do intend the good and advantage of their Neighbour, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge honeſtly the truſt of their employment, ſhall furniſh themſelves with the one and the other of theſe two Remedies.</p>

There are two kinds of Talk, the white <hi>viz.</hi> and the coloured: the white differs again in its kind; for there is the <hi>Venetian</hi> Talk which is greeniſh and breaks in thin ſcales, being eſteemed the beſt and the pureſt. There is alſo the <hi>Moſcovian,</hi> not ſo much valued as that which comes from <hi>Venice,</hi> but it has not a deſpicable quality, though it ſeems ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs pure. The ſecond kind of Talk is coloured and is red and black, wherereof <hi>Paracelſus</hi> makes mention in his Chronicles of <hi>Carinthia;</hi> Chymical Authors uſe ſometimes in an aenigmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Language to call Talk <hi>the Star of the Earth.</hi>

                           <p>We ſhall give an Example of ſuch operations as may be made upon a coloured and uncoloured Talk, that we may not be reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the neglect and paſſing by of a ſtone, the preparation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath tormented ſo much and ſo violently torments yet every day, the brain of thoſe which labour in the extraction of its oyl, which hath ever been the Idol of the moſt famous <hi>Courteſans,</hi> for the help they pretend to receive from it in the preſervation and encreaſe of their beauty.

                           <p>The principal operation made upon Talk is the calcination of it; for this ſtone being of extraordinary fixedneſs, it muſt be the ſcope of our Artiſt to open it by this firſt preparation: and thoſe that have kept pretty big lumps of <hi>Venetian</hi> Talk ſix intire weeks in a Glaſſe-houſe fire, without finding any alteration in its weight,

                        <p>METALS are hard bodies, ductile and malleable, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a ſaline and Mercurial juice, coagulated in the earth by the ſtrength &amp; vertue of the heat of its own ſulphur. Now as we have ſaid above, that all things had their original from light, which by its ejaculation and irradiation did imprint and ſtamp the Idea and Character of its vertue in water as in a general and convenient Matrix, to enable her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170969:239"/>to ſupply both matter and Form, Body and Spirit, Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, all phyſical generations: ſo can we now more pathetically and particularly give to underſtand the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Metals, becauſe the water being once ſtampt with the Character of Light, and having received the Spirit and Salt which flow from the ſame Spring, the internal Sulphur begins imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to concoct, digeſt and ripen the Embryos by him precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether animal, vegetable or mineral: and the water being furniſhed with this fermentative and generative principle, yet undeterminated and apt to be made any thing, is conveighed and driven into all the general and particular Matrixes, which do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine and modifie it according to the Idea and Character of their natural predeſtination in their Creation; For as God hath once created all ſubſtances, ſo has he given them means of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and perpetuating and preſerving themſelves, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but that which we call <hi>Nature.</hi> Now aſſoon as the water is received in a metallick Matrix or in a place fitted and deſtinated by Nature to the generating of Metals, the ſpirit of Salt which is in the water yet undetermined and of a general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, receives the vitriolick ſtamp, character and Idea, which is the firſt determination to Metallick nature, and the internal ſulphur of this embryonated Vitriol, works without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to digeſt, ripen, and concoct and coagulate the water by him impregnated; ſo that the firſt viſible principle of Metals is a Vitriol more or leſſe pure, and more or leſſe mixed with metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſeeds, according as the Matrix, water and ſalt are found to be pure or mixed. And thus the <hi>Archeus</hi> which directs metallick productions, doth lead and guide them ſafely and by a gradation altogether ſurprizing, and wonderful to the ſcope and end of their Natural predeſtination. For it alters and changes the Vitriol into ſulphur of a Metallick nature, as it is proved be the examining of Marcaſſites, which do already by their weight appear to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick, as alſo by their hardneſs and colour, and have nevertheleſs in them no more then a Vitriol altered and modified by the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fire of its ſulphur, as it may be proved by their Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my made by the help of ayr and fire, which the Artiſt doth make uſe of to decoct and bring them again to their firſt viſible matter, which is nothing elſe but a Sulphur and Vitriol, though theſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſites
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170969:239"/>contain alſo in themſelves ſome embryonated Metals, as it appears by the digeſtion and maturation of them made by fire, Salts and Spirits, after which Metals of divers kind and different nature may be extracted, and ſo <hi>illud quod occullum erat fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Thus much we thought fitting to ſay as a preliminary Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the deſcription of each Metal in particular, and of the operations which we will teach upon every one of them, which will be enough to guide and be inſtead of models to Artiſts, towards reaſoning and working more exactly upon the family of Metals. Metals are divided into three Claſſes, and that with much reaſon, partly for the diſparity and conformity of their hardneſs, partly for the reſemblance of their preparations. The firſt Claſſis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the nobleſt Metals, which are Gold and Silver or <hi>Sol and Luna,</hi> ☉ and <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> by the reaſon of the great correſpondency which is found between thoſe two potent Luminaries and thoſe two noble Metals: for what the Sun and Moon are in Heaven, the ſame are the Heart and Brain in Animals, and the Gold and Silver amongſt Minerals and Metals. The ſecond Claſſis contains the two inferiour and leſs noble Metals and the hardeſt, Copper and Iron, or <hi>Venus and Mars,</hi> ♀ and ♂, by reaſon of the analogy which is found between thoſe two Planets and thoſe two Metals, and the mutual and reciprocal love alſo which is between thoſe two celeſtial Bodies; <hi>Venus</hi> commands over the parts deſtinated to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and all the functions of the Kidnies and Bladder: and <hi>Mars</hi> ſends its influences upon the Liver, the <hi>Cyſtis Fellis</hi> or gall-Bladder, Spleen and adjacent parts of the Ventricle. The third Claſſis contains the two other leſs noble Metals, which are
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170969:240"/>ſofter and ſweeter then the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Lead and Tin, or <hi>Saturne and Jupiter,</hi> ♄ and ♃, by reaſon of the reſemblance which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Metals, who Command upon the Spleen and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix of the <hi>Microcoſm:</hi> But of this we will ſpeak more fully when we treat of each Metal aſunder. It is only requiſite to ſubjoin here in general terms all the operations commonly made upon Metals, to render them uſeful to Phyſick.</p>
                        <p>The firſt preparation which our Artiſt is bound to take in hand upon the Body of Metals, is <hi>Purification.</hi> The ſecond is their <hi>Calcination,</hi> which is performed five ſeveral wayes; The firſt of which is <hi>Immerſion,</hi> where Menſtruum's or appropriated Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvents are uſed. The ſecond is that which is called <hi>vaporous</hi> or <hi>illinition,</hi> which is performed by vapour or illinition or aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Diſſolvent. The third is <hi>Amalgama,</hi> made by the mixture of the Metal with ♉ or Quickſilver. The fourth is <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,</hi> performed by putting the Metals <hi>ſtratu ſuper stra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>um,</hi> or by ſtratification with Saline or ſulphureous ſubſtances, either to correct their defect, or to ſtraighten or compreſs, or to open the Metals. The fifth is <hi>Reverberation,</hi> performed by a flaming fire, until the Metal be reduced to a Calx capable of anſwering the deſign and intention of the Artiſt. The third preparation of Metals is <hi>Extraction,</hi> or to ſay better, the maturation and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the pureſt part, and of what is moſt concocted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in the internal ſulphur of Metals, from whence the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture proceeds. The fourth is <hi>Volatilization,</hi> which is nothing elſe but a total alteration of the metallick nature, ſo as the Artiſt may be capable to ſubtiliate them in ſuch manner as that they may aſcend or fly, that is to ſay, be turned into a Spirit or Oyle not reducible again afterwards into Metal, which is none of the leaſt operations of Chymiſtry. The fifth is <hi>Sublimation,</hi> by which Metals are meteoriz'd and reduced into vapours, which ſtick as flowers in the receiving Veſſels: ſome are of opinion, that this work is capable to better and maturate or ripen ignoble Metals, and not without ſome ground. The ſixth is the <hi>Salſification</hi> of Metals, which is the reduction of their body into Salt, a thing not of ſo eaſie performance as many Artiſts have imagined, becauſe ſome think to have done enough, if they have diſſolved the Metals with ſome Saline Menſtruum, and after that coagulated and chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalliz'd
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170969:240"/>in a diſſoluble ſubſtance, which is only to ſpeak properly, the vitriol of the Metals join'd to the ſaline ſubſtance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit made uſe of for their diſſolution, and returned to a body again with the Calx of the Metal. In the ſeventh place is <hi>Mercurifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or the pretended reduction of the ſolid and compact bodies of Metals in a Quckſilver or flowing Mercury, much like unto the common or vulgar Mercury, which I am alſo of opinion to be but a miſtake introduced amongſt Artiſts, and crept in only by want of true underſtanding of the meaning of Writers: for they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that when antient Authors have ſaid, that the Bodies of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals were to be reduced into Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, this laſt was to be underſtood of a flowing Quickſilver: But the meaning of theſe Philoſophers to my beſt apprehenſion, when they have ſpoken of reducing their Bodies into Mercury, was only to bring them again as near as could be to their Univerſality, that is to ſay, reducing them to a Spirit coming near the nature of the volatile ſulphureous Salts which are the laſt ſhelter and covering of the Spirit inviſible in it ſelf and of coagulated light: for as the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſalt of Vegetable ſeeds, contains in its ſelf the ſeminal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and the whole vertue of the plant; ſo likewiſe the Mercury or true ſpirit of metallick bodies contains in it ſelf their ſperme, their ingreſs and Tincture, and by conſequence all the vertue which it did poſſeſs, and all its power and activity ſince the firſt moment of its coagulation, to the laſt of its fixation: Wherefore it muſt be the chief ſcope of an Artiſt, to endeavour by his ſtudy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious working to reduce the King of Metals to that height of perfection, whereby to fit it and apply afterwards to the rooting out of the moſt obſtinate diſeaſes: but let him reject far from himſelf thoſe pretended ſeekers of flowing Mercury, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the ſearch and curioſity of it is uſeleſs and beyond Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reach: it is beſides an occaſion of waſting both the precious Time and Eſtate of thoſe that give up themſelves to it, and makes them loſe opportunities of diſcovering ſeveral other things uſeful to them in particular, and next to their Neighbour and Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>

                           <head>Of Gold and its Chymical preparation.</head>
                           <p>GOLD is the nobleſt, the moſt ſolid and fix of all Metals; of a yellowiſh colour, compacted, and of an almoſt indiviſible union in its ſubſtance, which ſhews him to be compounded of ſalt, ſulphur and mercury brought to the higheſt degree of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and for that reaſon moſt fix and intimately united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Chymiſts do give unto it the name of <hi>Sol, ſunne,</hi> and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute alſo to it the ſame Character Θ, becauſe it hath, ſay they, a ſympathy and correſpondency, both with the Sun of the great World, and of the little world which is mans Heart, and therefore do they aſcribe unto it the vertue and faculty of curing all faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and weakneſſes; they believe it finally to be the true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reſtorer of the Balſamick Faculties and natural hear, and the ſoveraign Remedy againſt Deliquium's and ſwoonings, loſſe of Spirits and waſting of radical moiſture. But there is an abuſe and miſtake in vulgar Pharmacy introduced by the <hi>Arabes,</hi> which do mingle Leaf-gold in their Confections and Cordial powders, as if the digeſtive heat of the ſtomach and the moiſture of imperfect Chyle were capable to alter in any wiſe the ſolidity of this noble Metal; for beſides that no humour analogous to <hi>Aqua Regia</hi> can be found in the Ventricle which might be capable of diſſolving Gold, yet ſuppoſing it might be performed by ſome ill fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſuperfluous aliments, it could not but cauſe mortal pains, and make ſuch ulcerations and preternatural colliquations, that they would infallibly deſtroy the ſubject wherein they ſhould be, rather then meliorate and reſtore the vital and animal Faculties as it is pretended. But ſome perhaps will object, That though Gold be not diſſolved in the Ventricle, it is not altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome good uſe, by reaſon of the irradiations and emanations of its vertue which it ſends to the Heart in reſpect of their mutual ſympathy; To which I anſwer, That it will ſuffice for the ſame reaſon to carry it above the body, and thus make an outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it more eaſie and in greater quantity then what can be ſwallowed; and ſo would it prove much more beneficial then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170969:241"/>inwardly taken in ſmall quantity, and moreover there would be no loſs of it; which makes us conclude that unleſs Gold be prepared and opened in ſuch a manner, as that our digeſtive heat may be capable to appropriate its vertue unto its ſelf by the help of the volatile ſulphureous Salts, which are mingled in the aliments of the body either dry or moiſt, or unleſs Art hath already ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this metal into Medicine, by the aſſiſtance of Salts and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which may be analogous to thoſe of orature and free from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſiveneſs, that it may be rendred fit to be conveighed and driven by the Director of our natural Functions into our very laſt dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, thereby to correct all the defects it ſhall meet with, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie by the impreſſion of its Cordial and Solar Vertue the whole maſſe of the venal and arterial blood, otherwiſe no good is to be hoped or expected from it; but contrariwiſe ſome ill effect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncapable to produce any other in caſe it be prepared with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive Salts or Spirits: and being not diſſolved nor opened, it is unfit to do any good.</p>
                           <p>They that will chuſe well their Gold for Chymical preparations, muſt take it of the pureſt and of that which hath received the leſſe allay; for to make any difference between the <hi>Indian</hi> Gold and that of <hi>Arabia, Hungary, Bohemia</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> is a very needleſſe Nicety, ſince by the ordinary purifications it may be brought to the higheſt degree of purity and goodneſſe; and thoſe are the following.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, There is a purification made of Gold, to take away the ſuperficial ſetling or foulneſſe; Secondly, That which is done to take away ſome portion of one or more imperfect metals, which were mingled either in the Mint or by the Goldſmiths, or finally brought from the Mine. For the firſt purification waſh the Gold in a crude Lye, or water impregnated with Tartar and common Salt, which is called <hi>a Bullitory,</hi> or make it boyl and waſh in <hi>aqua fortis</hi> ſomething weak or mixt with phlegm of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, Salt-peter or Vitriol, theſe three Lotions are ſufficient for the firſt intention.</p>
                           <p>But when ſome part of imperfect metals is mixed with the Gold, the ſeparation cannot be made but by dividing the metals aſunder, which cannot be done but by their diſſolution, which is called <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſive calcination,</hi> or by the deſtruction of the imperfect metal,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170969:242"/>as when Gold is purified by Lead or Antimony, or cemented with ſubſtances capable to corrode and deſtroy the imperfect metals mixed with the Gold.</p>
                           <p>As for the diſſolution, which is immerſive Calcination, it is performed with ij. iij. or iv. p. of Regal water, the diſtillation whereof we will teach when we ſhall Diſcourſe of Salts: for the Regal water will only diſſolve the Gold, and the other metals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the bottom of the Veſſel, chiefly if ſilver be predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, becauſe the Regal water touches in no way the ſilver: the diſſolution being made, filtrate it, and gently pour it out by decan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, then precipitate with oyle of ☿ <hi>per deliquium,</hi> or ſpirit of volatile Armoniack Salt, or ſpirit of Urine, or throwing it in ſome proportion of quick-ſilver, which will gather to its ſelf the Gold which was diſperſed in the diſſolution, or by evaporating the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving water: finally, which way ſoever you reduce the Gold to Calx, there remains no more to be done after then to melt it in a Crucible with a little Borax, and caſt it into Ingots, and you ſhall have purified Gold.</p>
                           <p>But if you will only put it in the Capel, and drive it with Lead to ſeparate the heterogeneous metals, you muſt make your Capel with Bean aſhes, putting ij. or iij. p. of Lead, which with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of fire and bellow's muſt be driven, as we ſhall more fully deduct when we treat of the purifying of Silver. But becauſe the Capel doth not take away wholly the ſuſpition of ſome remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of ſilver being yet intimately mixed with the Gold: Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts have not found a better way to purifie it totally then to melt it with Antimony, becauſe the ſulphur of that mineral doth abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely corrode and deſtroy, not only all imperfect metals which might be mixed with the Gold, but it alſo deſtroyes totally the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſilver, be it in never ſo little a quantity, if the purification be reiterated three times: which being done you may confidently ſay that the Gold is very pure, and that there can be no finer, and it is thus performed: Take as much Gold as you will, and add thereto v. or vj. parts of crude Antimony, put them in a good Crucible to melt together in a wind-Furnace, and when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter flowes, throw in about ℥ j. of pure Salt-peter very pure and dry mixt with <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. or iij. of filings of Iron, and when all is well melted and flowing together glowing, and of a colour tending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170969:242"/>Partridge eyes (as they call it) throw the matter in a ſharp earthen Veſſel, ſuch as is fit to make Regulus (of the figure of an inverted Pyramid) being hot and firſt anointed with it with a piece of wax down to the bottom, and when it is full with the melted matter, knock gently with a Hammer on the brims of your Veſſel until a cruſt and thick skin covers over the matter, that being a great help to make the Regulus fall to the bottom and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the feces and ſcum from the pure part: the matter being cooled, ſeparate the Regulus from the skum, and mix it again a ſecond time with p. ij. of Antimony crude, reduced to powder, and melt as before, and about the end of the melting of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter throw a little Salt-peter and filings of Iron, to ſeparate the reſt of the Regulus from the ſcum or feces, in the impurity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome part of the Gold might remain yet hidden, and this work may be reiterated even to the third time, that no portion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus may remain untoucht, and by conſequence the Artiſt may reſt ſecure that no part of the Gold is left in it. Then reduce your ſolar Regulus in courſe powder, and place it in a good Crucible in a wind Furnace, and give it fire on all ſides, above, beneath and in the ſides, to drive the Antimony by ſmoak: you may alſo add to it the help of bellowes to advance the work and ſo give it fire, continuing to blow until all the ſubſtance of the Antimony be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled into vapours, and the Gold remaineth pure and clean in the bottom of the Crucible. They that will not be at ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, may make uſe of the Regulus of Antimony ready prepared to purifie their Gold: but the firſt way is the beſt, becauſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus is already diveſted of the greateſt part of his external ſulphur, which is the fitteſt for corroding the imperfect metals mixt with the Gold.</p>
                           <p>It remains we ſhould ſpeak of the third way of purifying Gold, which is Cementation, being nothing elſe but putting the Gold beaten into thin plates ſtratified in a Crucible, or ungla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed earthen pot of a convenient bigneſs with common or Regal Cement, and the plates thus well fitted, giving a circular fire by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the ſpace of three or four hours, then encreaſing it during the ſpace of ſix hours more, in ſuch a manner as the Pot or Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible may become glowing red at the end of the operation of the fire. And thus ſhall you find the plates of Gold purged of all
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170969:243"/>that imperfect metal which might have been lurking in them, the matter of the Cement having deſtroyed, burned and calcined the metal; then grind the maſſe found in the Crucible, and waſh the plates, to purifie them afterwards by melting with a little of Salt-peter and Borax, or with corroſive Sublimate.</p>

                           <p>That Calcination which is performed by Amalgamation of the Gold with Mercury or quick ſilver is free from ſuſpition of any violent Corroſion, which may impart to the Gold any kind of hidden corroſiveneſſe, as it is generally feared all ſalts and corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſpirits will do: though we muſt confeſs however, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpirits nor ſalts can be capable to communicate any ill qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to Gold; neither diveſt him of the character of being a metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick body, unleſs they be extraordinary ſalts and ſpirits, and to the knowledge of whom thoſe Authors which have left us any thing by writing have not attained, or in caſe they have ſaid any thing of it, it hath been in ſo obſcure and aenigmatical terms as it is plain to be ſeen, that either they would not be underſtood by others, or could not underſtand themſelves: for there is not one Artiſt but knows that water and fire can purge the calx of Gold from thoſe impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of corroſive ſalts and ſpirits, either by Lotion or Reverbera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: wherefore it muſt remove all occaſion of fear from ſuch as would entertain any ſcruple in this particular. For all what in paſt-time Artiſts have done, or do at the preſent, is to no other end and deſign then to open the body of Gold, and render it capable of being diſſolved and extracted without any Corroſive. We will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver in the following Diſcourſe, the ſureſt way and method which practice and ſtudy hath brought to our knowledge, leaving the reſt to the diſquiſition of ſuch as will make a further progreſs in this Work.</p>

                           <p>BEat in very thin plates Gold three times refined by Antimony, and being cut very ſmall with ſheeres or ſciſſars, put ſome part of the Gold in a ſmall Crucible, and heat it red hot, and at the ſame time put in another Crucible ℥ vj. of crude Mercury, and place it alſo to the fire until it begins to ſmoak, then pour it upon the Gold thus red, and ſtir them both nimbly together with a ſmall ſtick of wood, and when all is reduced to a convenient ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, throw it in a Diſh half full of water; this done throw away the firſt water and pour new freſh water upon the Amalgam. and ſtir and waſh it therein to ſeparate and cleanſe away all the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fuliginoſity thereof, and thus proceed until the water comes off from it as clean as it was poured on; this done, put this Amalgama which is tractable and unctuous in a ſmall Retort, to the neck whereof fit a Recipient with water; place this Retort between four bricks, &amp; give it an open fire by degrees, until all the Mercury be come over the Helm into the Recipient, and the Gold remains pure and open in the bottom of the Retort; but that cannot be done neither at the firſt nor ſecond time; contrariwiſe, the amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamation and diſtillation muſt be reiterated ſucceſſively at leaſt xx. or xxx. times, even until the Gold remains open, ſpongious, and capable of being reduced to powder of it ſelf. Now as that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a toylſome and tedious operation; Artiſts have found a way to ſeparate and diſcontinue in a leſs time and with much more ſpeed the parts of Gold after amalgamation, which is performed by cementing it with common ſalt deſiccated, or powder of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; for the Amalgam being grounded with double its weight of ſalt and brimſtone, it diſcontinues or ſeparates its parts into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles or atomes ſo ſmall, that it enables the fire afterwards joined to thoſe matters to calcine it with much more eaſe, and thus it is much ſooner reduced into ſubtil powder and ſo well opened, that it is capable afterwards of being reverberated, and brought by the ſole action of fire to a fitting ſtate of Rarity, and requiſite ſpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſneſs, which is thus performed.</p>

                           <p>THough we have ſpoken above of the cementation of Gold, our Artiſt ſhall remember that it was only to teach how to try and purifie the ſame: but what we are now about to teach, is to the end of Calcining and opening its Body as we have already ſaid; the Artiſt then ſhall thus proceed therein. Let him take the Amalgam after it is well waſht and dried with a clean linnen cloth, ſo that all moiſture be taken off, and preſs and wring it as much as he can through a piece of chamoy skin, to ſeparate from it the ſuperfluous Mercury, then let him weigh the remainder, and grind it on a Porphyry ſtone with double its weight of <hi>ſulphurvivium</hi> or quick-brimſtone powdered, and that until the Brimſtone and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malgam be ſo exactly united and commixed that you may diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh neither of the ſubſtances, then put this powder in a Crucible of an indifferent bigneſs, that none of the Gold may be loſt by the cracking and working of the Brimſtone; cover alſo exactly the Crucible with a cover having a hole in the top, of the bigneſs of a writing Qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then reiterate this Amalgamation and both Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations with Brimſtone and Salt, each of them ſeven times, which are in all 21 operations, and ſo ſhall you have a powder or Calx of Gold capable of being expoſed to Reverberation, as we ſhall now declare.</p>

                           <p>TAke ℥ φ. of Gold refined by Antimony and beat it into very thin plates or leaves, then put it in a Cucurbite with ℥ x. of very good well refined Salt-peter, ℥ viij.

Take half of this Maſſe, reduce it to powder which pour in a Matraſs, and put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alkoholizate ſpirit of Wine three fingers high, put a Blindhead upon the Veſſel containing your matter, and place in ſand, giving it a fire of digeſtion and extraction, and in a ſhort time the Spirit will be ting'd with a very pleaſant yellow colour; this Spirit ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laid in digeſtion the ſpace of three dayes, you muſt filtrate it and pour on freſh at the ſame height, and continue the dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of it, till it hath attained the ſame colour of the firſt ſpirit already drawn off, and ſo proceed in this digeſtion and extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on until the third or fourth time, or rather until the Spirit takes no more Tincture; then join all theſe Tinctures together, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filtrated put them in a very clean and dry Cucurbite, which place in <hi>B.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170969:246"/>this coagulation doth not hinder it from having ſtill its colour, and a bitter harſhneſs, which ſhews the Gold to have diveſted its Body ſo far as to become an analogous ſubſtance to its vitriolick prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, whereof it hath the caſt and relliſh. I do not deny but that this Gold may be in a manner reduced to a body again; but I deny that it may be altogether brought to it: and that ſince the moſt pure ſpirit of Wine hath been capable to extract it from the ſalts that had diſſolved it by the only help of Rain-water, part of this Gold muſt of neceſſity be ſo altered, as to have been brought ſome part of the way towards its firſt matter. Wherefore I do not altogether reject the inward uſe of this Tincture of Gold, though it hath not yet attained all the perfection which the true Tincture or true potable Gold ought to have: for as I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd by the experience of many of my Friends, and my own in particular, I cannot contradict it, ſince we make uſe every day with very good ſucceſs of the diſſolutions and ſalts of other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, though yet reducible to a metallick Body, as it appears in the Remedies taken from <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> which have alſo in them this ſweet vitriolick and Pontick Salt according to their reſpective propriety and Nature, as Gold alſo hath its bitterneſs; And nevertheleſs, the taſte of theſe preparations which are made upon <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> are commonly taken by us for concluding To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of their vertue and of thoſe good effects we hope from them, which makes me not to be averſe to recommend the uſe of this Tincture, provided it be adminiſtred in a convenient time in a proper Menſtruum, and the Doſis be exactly obſerved according to age, ſtrength and the exigency of the Diſeaſe; The Doſis muſt be from <hi>gutt. ſs.</hi> to iij. or iv. in Wine, Broth, Scorzonera Root-water, Buck-horn or Balm-water. The Diſeaſes for which it is moſt proper, are all thoſe that have ſome virulent quality or ſome malignancy; all thoſe wherein ſtrength or ſpirits does fail or is impaired; the Patient muſt be covered after he hath taken it, and ſo expect the moſt calmly and patiently he can the effects which this Remedy will produce, which moſt commonly happen by Sweat, ſometimes alſo by Urines and Stools; for as it naturally doth ſtrengthen all the natural Functions, ſo doth it drive away all the evil and heterogeneous matter which it meets with in the body, by thoſe Emunctories which Nature

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170969:248"/>even be ſeparated from its impurities contracted in the matrix of the Earth, or accidentally by allay; for it is not ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purated either in the hands of Goldſmiths or Mint-maſters: for as to cleanſe it from its outward ſoil and impurities, it is eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by boiling the ſame in water impregnated with Tartar and common Salt; after it hath been neal'd or made glowing red in the fire, and thence caſt into Urine and then Water, thus ſhall it be very pure in what concerns the outſide: but if you will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purifie it from its alloy, or allowance in the Mint, you muſt make uſe of diſſolution which is the immerſive Calcination, and melt it by drying in a Cupel with Lead purpoſely made for this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of purifying Silver, and that before you expoſe it to other Calcinations which muſt be previous to the preparations of this Metal, that it may thereby be made fitting for diſſolution and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of its Tincture, the three principal whereof are, <hi>immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Calcination, Amalgation, and Cementation;</hi> for very ſeldom reverberating Calcination is made uſe of, becauſe Silver having leſs fixity then Gold, it needs not conſequently any long and powerful action of the fire to become ſufficiently opened. As for the firſt ſeparation of ſuch impurities and Metals as are mixt in Silver, you muſt diſſolve it in three or four parts of <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> made with Vitriol and Salt-peter as we ſhall teach hereafter; then precipitate it in a Calx or powder with ſalt, water, <hi>viz.</hi> water in which you have diſſolved common ſalt, as much as the water can bear, which is alſo called amongſt the Artiſts <hi>Pontick</hi> or <hi>Marine water;</hi> or put ſmall Copper plates in the ſaid diſſolution, and weaken the <hi>aqua fortis</hi> with common water, and the Copper will draw and gather to it ſelf all the Silver in form of a white pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but which way ſoever you make this precipitation of Silver, you muſt afterwards by ſeveral reiterated Lotions edulcorate the powder or calx of Silver with common water, and then dry the ſame. But becauſe this Calx is not yet free from ſome mixture, it is neceſſary to Cupell it, and drive it with three or four times as much of Lead upon the ſaid Cupel, being covered with a piece of wood dry, and adapted to the proportion of the hollow, with good coals fitted about, and blown with a great quickneſs and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of fire, till the Lead vaniſhing hath carried away in its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouring all the impurities and heterogeneous metallick mixture of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170969:249"/>the Silver, or that the Lead be all drunk up by the Cupel, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted on the top of it in a skum or excrement of calcinated Lead, which is commonly called <hi>Litharg,</hi> more or leſs red and high in colour, according as it hath more or leſs participated of the heat of the fire. The moſt remarkable thing in this operation is, that the Silver being once refined and purified, it growes hard in the midſt of the moſt violent fire, though a little before it did run like water, whilſt the Lead was yet Maſter over it, and ſome mixture of impurity did remain.</p>
                           <p>The Silver thus left upon the Cupel is very pure, and cannot be ſuſpected to be guilty of any bad mixture; this is that which Artiſts call <hi>highly Refined,</hi> and <hi>ſilver of Cupel:</hi> Take then of this q. ſ. and having made it into very thin plates or ſmall filings, put in a Matraſs, and pour it upon three times its weight of good <hi>aq. fortis,</hi> or what would yet be better, of good ſpirit of Niter, put it in ſand or aſhes to digeſt and accelerate the diſſolution, and being ended, decant it in a ſmall Cucurbite, to ſeparate what impurities might remain in the bottom of the Matraſs; after this draw off half of the Menſtruum again in aſhes and let the Veſſel cool, and the next morning ſhall you find your Silver reduced into Cryſtals, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſome are called <hi>the vitriol of Silver;</hi> theſe dry gently and keep in a well ſtopt viol, to adminiſter to ſuch as are ſick with ſome Cephalick diſeaſe, to purge them: The Doſis muſt be from ij. <hi>gr.</hi> to x. in Broth, or ſome opening Cephalick Decoction; they purge very gently, and do powerfully disburthen the Head of all bad and noxious humours.</p>
                           <p>After this precipitate the liquor which ſwam above the Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals with ſalt water, to have the calx of <hi>Lune</hi> or Silver, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulcorate and dry, to make therewith the following preparations: and this is that which Writers call <hi>calcined Silver,</hi> or <hi>calx of Lune.</hi> We will give three Examples of the Extraction of Tincture of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which is called <hi>potable Lune</hi> or <hi>Silver,</hi> to make the Artiſt the better to apprehend the manner of working, becauſe the Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um's, as alſo the manner of the work, are differing one from the other.</p>

                           <p>IRON is one of the two Metals of the ſecond Claſſis, which is that of the leſs noble and moſt hard of metals. It is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of a Mercury and Sulphur, the crudeſt and leaſt fuſible of all; or again, if you will, Iron is compounded of a Mercury, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur and Salt, which are mixt with many terreſtrial and crude parts; in a word, no metal abounds more in Vitriol then Iron or <hi>Mars</hi> doth, ſo named by reaſon of the analogy it hath with that Planet, as we already have ſaid above; Iron or <hi>Mars</hi> is one of the Metals which ſupplies with more Remedies the ſhop of our Chymical Artiſt, and one of thoſe that produces the moſt effects and moſt pathetical. We will deliver here the method of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the moſt uſeful for the health of poor Patients, and the moſt neceſſary for the inſtruction of Artiſts: ſuch as are firſt the Gradatory Perfectibility (if I may ſo ſpeak) which purifies Iron of all its impurities, and changes it into that ſubſtance we call Steel, which to ſpeak properly, is nothing elſe but a well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted and cloſe well depurated Iron.

                           <head>How the <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> aperitive is to be prepared.</head>
                           <p>VVEE will deliver two manners of preparing this aperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Crocus</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> as we have ſhewed two for the aſtringent <hi>Crocus.</hi> The firſt manner is by taking <abbr>lb</abbr> j. of Filings or duſt of Needles very clean, which put in a ſtone earthen Pan very flat, then by degrees and gently moiſten it with Dew-water, if your work falls in <hi>May,</hi> elſe Rain-water of the vernal Equinox, until the Filings begin to crumble, at which ſign proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſt you ſhould drown your matter; for when it is only moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened in the form of a paſt or crums, it ferments and grows hot of it ſelf with water, as by the touch and ſmell it may eaſily be noted: for there is a certain ſaline Spirit hidden in theſe waters which penetrates the Steel, and inſenſibly diſſolves it: wherefore it muſt immediately be dryed in the Sun, and being dry, grinded on a Marble, and ſo moiſtened again without drowning, and in leſſe then three or four dayes all the Filings will be converted into a black powder, which will begin to draw to a Violet purple colour in the ſuperficies, and by a ſmall taſte of ink, or ſomewhat vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, ſheweth, that the water begins to make the reincrudation of the metal into his ſeminal principles, which are Sulphur and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol; for when the water is put upon it, it ſends forth a ſulphureous odour, and the taſte doth manifeſtly declare and diſcover the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol. Note, that your matter muſt be grinded on the Marble as often as you dry it, and if you will diſcharge the parr of a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Artiſt, you may make three exſiccations every day, and end the operation in three weeks, otherwiſe you muſt beſtow at leaſt a moneth or ſix weeks, before the body of this metal may be reduced to an impalpable powder, which is coloured with a brown purple Violet, which having got, put it in a crude Iron Pot or Caldron, and upon open fire Reverberate, ſtirring it ſtill with a Rod or ſlice of Iron, and as ſoon as it begins to grow red, take it away, and you ſhall have the aperitive Reverberated <hi>Crocus</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> in a fair red brown colour. But it is much better not to reverberate it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this heat may cauſe the Vitriol that begun to be fram'd in the <hi>Crocus,</hi> to exhale away, and this vitriolick ſalt only conſtitutes its
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170969:254"/>aperitive vertue. The Doſis of this <hi>Crocus</hi> muſt be from iij. <hi>gr.</hi> to xx. and xxx. provided it be given by degrees, and the ſtomach uſed to it by little an little; it is adminiſtred in Opiats and Conſerves or mixt amongſt aromatical Powders; it muſt be taken faſting,, or the ſtomach being empty three or four houres before meales, and the Patient muſt walk after in ſome ſmooth and pleaſant place; after the walk take a Btoth of Veal and Chicken made with Parſly and Spaniſh Scorzonera Roors. This Remedy is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for all Chronical Diſeaſes, Cachexy, Leucophlegmacy, and all other Diſeaſes proceeding from ſplenetical obſtructions, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the Liver, Meſentery and Pancreas; but there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome other Martial Remedies more quick and efficacious in their operation, as we will ſhew hereafter.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond manner of preparing the opening <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> is this. Take a bar of good Steel and make it glowing in a Smiths Forge, in that degree of heat which they call <hi>ſo ering heat,</hi> which is a kind of half-fuſion, and being thus, have a great Pan full of water, over which you ſhall hold your Steel, and apply cloſe to it a cake of Brimſtone, which will melt the Steel, and drop by drop precipitate it in the water in ſmall graines; continue this work until you have a ſufficient quantity of the Steel in graine, which muſt be ſeparated from the Brimſtone that fell dropping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the Steel in the water, then beat it in an Iron morter to powder, which muſt be run through a delicate ſieve or Tamy, then prepared on a Porphyry ſtone, or Sea-ſhel with ſome opening water, until it be reduced to an Alkohol, the half whereof muſt be framed into Trochisks, when dryed and ſo kept; this is called <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Steel.</hi> Then take the other half and reverberate it in an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron Cauldron with naked fire, as we have ſaid above, until it hath attained a red purple colour, without fear of conſuming the vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick faculty; but contrariwiſe it will open more and more, this preparation being different from that of the foregoing <hi>Crocus;</hi> the Doſis is the ſame with the other, the precautions the ſame, and the uſe of it for the ſame Diſeaſes; ſome there are that even do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to the other preparations, but I am of a contrary mind.</p>

                           <head>How the Vitriol of <hi>Mars</hi> is to be prepared.</head>
                           <p>TAke Filings or duſt of Needles very clean, and put it in a Glaſs Cucurbite, pouring by degrees upon it acid or ſharp ſpirit of Vitriol, not altogether deprived of its phlegm; ſtir both together with an Iron ſlice, pouring as much of it as that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be well imbid'd and ſatiated therewith, and have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care not to break the Cucurbite, and immediately pour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſtilled Rain-water, or Rain-water taken up in the Equinox without diſtilling, which may be almoſt boyling hot, to the height of four fingers, place the Cucurbite in ſand already heated, and there leave it in digeſtion and diſſolution the ſpace of xij. hours; which done, filtrate the warm Liquor and put it to evaporate gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the conſumption of one half in the vapour of a boyling Balneo, and then place it in a cold Room to ſhute Chryſtals, which you ſhall finde the next morning bright and green round about the Veſſel, which put between two papers, and dry in a ſlow and gentle heat; and if you deſire a greater quantity, purſe the ſame work upon the remaining duſt or Filings with the ſpirit of Vitriol; then with warm water filtrate, evaporate and chryſtallize until the whole body of the metal be converted into Vitriol, or a litle of earthly ſediment remains if the Filings were pure: But the quantity of your Vitriol will go much beyond the weight of the Filings, exceeding ſometimes even to a third part: by which the Artiſt may be taught that it is but a Recorporification of Vitriol, having reſumed his vitriolick Idea and Character by the help of <hi>Mars,</hi> as being a body which was once vitriol: but we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that this Vitriol ſurpaſſes much in excellency the common Vitriol, out of which the ſpirit uſed in this Work hath been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled: for the recorporified Spirits have a great ſphere of activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and do much more powerfully work, then the matters purely and meerly naturally. This Vitriol hath more efficacy and acts with much more quickneſſe then the aperitive <hi>Crocus,</hi> in all the Diſeaſes which we have before mentioned, but the Doſis is much leſſe: for it is given beginning with one <hi>gr.</hi> and ſo continuing by
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170969:255"/>degrees till you come to viij. x. and xij. <hi>gr.</hi> either in Bolus in ſome Preſerve, or in Broth. But you muſt note, that the uſe of Remedies extracted from the <hi>Mars,</hi> muſt be long continued and taken ſtill, encreaſing from j. <hi>gr.</hi> to ij. until at laſt it begins to raiſe and provoke the ſtomach and cauſe a nauſeouſneſſe; then go back from ij. <hi>gr.</hi> or ſomewhat more, becauſe it appears that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is then in the right time of bringing the Remedy to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſucceſſe without much violence, if it be not encreaſed: You muſt note beſides, that thoſe that uſe Steel-Remedies, ought to be purged every fourth day, in caſe the Remedy it ſelf doth not provoke Nature, and every other day the belly muſt be opened by a Glyſter of pure new made ſtale: for as the Steel hath a diſſopilating and opening Vitriol, ſo hath it likewiſe a conſtipating and drying earth; wherefore every fourth or fifth day infuſe <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ij. Sennae with ℈ j. vitriolated Tartar in Veal or Chicken Broth, to carry away and drive out of the body thoſe matters which the Remedy hath made fit for evacuation. Thoſe that deſire to have a very fine and uſeful <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> muſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine ℥ iiij. of this vitriol of <hi>Mars</hi> in a Crucible with open fire, until it be converted into a fair ſubtile red powder, having no ill or unſavory taſte, and fit to be given to the moſt delicate Palats, in Bolus, Lozenges; or Opiates from v. <hi>gr.</hi> to xxx. with the ſame obſervations and precautions as are hinted above.</p>

It will not be very difficult to perſwade the leſſe knowing, that Exttact or Syrup, is one of the beſt Remedies produced by the Art of Chymiſtry; for it is known to all, that Tartar is a friendly Salt to our Nature, and of it ſelf a great opener and diſopila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Remedy; there are alſo very few but know, that Phyſitians have in all Ages made uſe both of crude and prepared Steel, or its Crocus to open obſtructions, and for the cure of chronical and obſtinate Diſeaſes, which have ſeated in the Region of the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170969:256"/>Ventricle, Liver, Spleen and other adjacent parts: But I can very ſincerely ſay, that all what we have delivered above, muſt give way to this Martial Extract; for after that Tartar is once inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately united to the <hi>Mars,</hi> and that both have acted and reacted one upon another in ſuch a manner, that the one hath loſt its great a cidity, and the other its metallick corporeity as it hath happened in this operation, a third ſubſtance reſults from thence endowed with all neceſſary qualifications, to act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the intent of the Phyſitian, <hi>Citò tutò, jucundè:</hi> for this admirable Remedy can never be hurtful, but alwayes profitable and good, as we our ſelves have found it by experience, in the cure of many great and dangerous maladies made by the due adminiſtration of this noble Medicine; which is given very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately and with a ſurprizing and unconceivable ſucceſſe, in the beginning of the ſwellings of Dropſies, againſt the ſchirrous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of the Spleen, againſt all obſtructions of the parts of the inferiour Ventricle, againſt the pains of the Reines and Bladder, againſt the evil fermentations of the ſtomach, againſt Wormes in young and old, the ſeminary whereof it doth radically extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate; againſt intermittent Feavers, chiefly thoſe which Phyſitians call <hi>Stomach Feavers;</hi> and to be ſhort, generally againſt all coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations of tartarous matters in whatſoever part of the body ſeated.

This Salt is a very ſubtil and pleaſant Aperitive, which is adminiſtred in Broths or Apozema's, or even may be given as a true Martial Tartar, without any danger of the <hi>aqua fortis</hi> uſed in the diſſolution; for it is to be known, that all the corroſion of the ſpirit of <hi>aqua fortis</hi> is blunted and deaded by its own action upon the Steel, as it may be perceived by the pleaſing taſte of the Chryſtals reſulting thereof. The Doſis muſt be from vj. <hi>gr.</hi> to xx. and xxx. and if the Artiſt be curious, he may take ℥ ij. of the Chryſtals, and as much of very fair Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack ſalt, and grind and mix them together, and being put in a luted Matraſs, place it in ſand, ſo as it may lye but a fingers breadth from the Iron veſſel containing the ſand; then by a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual fire, drive it ſo high that the Armoniack ſalt may ſublimate and carry along with it ſelf the ſulphur of <hi>Mars,</hi> and ſo ſhall he have Flowers very red and efficacious for a Diaphoretick and Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Remedy againſt intermittent Agues, and chiefly againſt Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and Quartains; and if you have ſublimated of theſe Flowers in any conſiderable quantity, you may diſſolve one part thereof in warm water, to ſeparate the ſalt from it by edulcoration and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and you ſhall have the true ſulphur or <hi>Mars</hi> in its perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which you may uſe as a ſoveraign Diaphoretick.

But as we have ſaid of Iron, ſo may we of Copper, that it hath much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol in it ſelf, and leſſe of earth then Iron, and by conſequence leſſe impurity. It is amongſt Chymiſts called <hi>Venus</hi> ♀, becauſe it receives the influences of that Planet, and relates to the parts
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170969:259"/>in Man dedicated to generation. The general vertues of Copper are, to ſtrengthen the ſpermatical and generative parts, both in male and female, inſomuch as that the Antients and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf and his ſucceſſors after him have had it in great eſteem, and made very frequent uſe of it though in a rude and courſe way, being not yet aſſiſted with the light of Chymiſtry, which doth from this metal draw admirable Remedies, and particularly that wonderful Spirit of ♀ <hi>Venus,</hi> whereof we have ſpoken above, and whereto we are already come.</p>
                           <p>We could very well lay down and deliver here all the manners of calcining Copper, either by Diſſolution, Illinition or Cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but as all theſe operations do rather relate to the metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick then Phyſical part, we will not inſiſt on it to purſue inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly and with leſſe intermiſſion, our purpoſe of diſcovering the noble Remedies which metals do afford us; we will then firſt ſpeak of the preparation of green Copper or Verdegreaſe, which is more full of myſterie then is commonly imagined, though this operation be common, and performed only by the Women and Maids at <hi>Montpellier.</hi>

                           <p>All theſe Tinctures then muſt be joined together, and filtrated cold through Paper, and the filtration put to evaporate in an earthen ſtone Pan, in a ſlow beat in the vapour of <hi>B.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170969:260"/>green as <hi>Emerald;</hi> and when you ſhall ſee the evaporating Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor to begin to contract a skin in the upper part, put the Pan wherein it is in a cold place, and let it reſt there until the next day, and you ſhall find in the bottom and ſides of the Veſſel Chryſtals of fair blew Vitriol, which having put between two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, dry in a very ſlow and moderate heat; for the Sun is even capable to deprive this Vitriol from its beſt ſpirit, ſo volatile it is; wherefore the Artiſt muſt be very circumſpect and wary in this particular, leſt otherwiſe he be taught to become ſo at his own charge and by his own experience. And if the laſt Chryſtals, or even the firſt extracted, were not very fair, blew and tranſparent, let them be diſſolved in new diſtilled vinegar, and let there be no more then the juſt or fitting quantity to diſſolve them cold; let the diſſolution reſt without ſtirring 24 houres, that in caſe there be any atoms of feculent matter ſeparated and rais'd in the firſt evaporation, they may ſettle again.

So that they which deſire to be yet more accurate and ſucceſſeful in their operation, muſt proceed in the diſſolution of their Chryſtals in new diſtilled vinegar, until they can diſcover by trying a diſtillation in <hi>B.

This being ſo, you have attained the true Point of requiſite perfection which this noble Vitriol muſt be brought unto; then dry it very ſlowly and gently between two Papers, to make the ſpirit thereof as we ſhall immediately teach, after it hath beed digeſted three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times with very good alkaholiz'd ſpirit of Wine, three fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers high above it, in a double or digeſting Veſſel the ſpace of 24 houres, and after that this ſpirit hath been drawn off every time in <hi>B.

                           <p>THis is the Operation wherein a Chymical Artiſt hath need of all his Patience and Judgement, if he will ſucceſsfully perform this intended Diſtillation, which will be to him a guide and a Pattern whereupon to proceed in all others, by reaſon of the great volatility of the matter he works upon. Let him then take his Vitriol when it is very dry, and reduce it to powder in a Marble Morter, then put it in a Retort with a long neck and wide mouth, and all that matter being put in, let him be carefull to cleanſe the uppermoſt part of the Retort, and the whole neck with a Feather tyed to a ſmall ſtick, that he may not be deceived in believing that the greeneſſe he ſhall perceive in the diſtilling drops ſhould have contracted their colour of Vitriol which might have been left there when it was poured in the Retort. After this he ſhall place his Retort in a cloſe Reverberatory Furnace, leaving four Regiſters on the corners of the roof of the Furnace, and another in the middle, to be able to govern the fire with more command and better moderation; wherefore theſe Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters muſt be ſtopt with cloſe and well-fitted ſtoples. Then let him fit a very capacious and large Glaſs Recipient very clean and dry to the neck of the Retort, and ſtop the joyning parts with a wet Bladder, and lute them moreover with Quick-lime and whites of Eggs, as we have often repeated in this Treatiſe; and when
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170969:261"/>the Lute is dry, let him begin to give his fire judiciouſly and ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, forbearing all haſtineſſe; and rather expecting with an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Patience that the matter ſhould by degrees drive and ſend up its vapours, which ſhall thicken and condenſe themſelves in the neck of the Retort, and fall by clear and limpid drops into the Recipient: for the noſe or mouth of the Retort muſt at leaſt advance four fingers deep in the body of the Recipient, that he may diſcern the diverſity of colour of the diſtilling drops; not ſo much to feed and ſatisfie his own curioſity, though it be a very pleaſant diverſion, as to regulate the better his fire, which in this Operation is one of the moſt important conſiderations; becauſe if he never ſo little encreaſes the fire without neceſſity, it may occaſion the loſſe of the whole ſubſtance, and the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Veſſels; wherefore he muſt be here vety vigilant to do nothing whereby he may receive a prejudice, a thing general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be obſerved in all other diſtillations of Salts, whereof our Artiſt intends to draw the Spirits. We thought fitting to deſcribe this circumſtance of the Work with all imaginable punctuality, that in caſe any by too much haſte and precipitancy comes to miſcarry, he may not lay the fault upon us. This tenor and ſtate of heat is he to keep ſo long as the drops ſhall fall clear, and not to urge his fire by any means: for the drops will fall faſt enough, if ſlowly you reckon ſix between the interval of every falling drop. But when the drops begin to turn green, and the white vapours to appear in the Recipient, and condenſe themſelves into Spirit and in a ſubtil Liquor which frames in the glaſſe Filaments and winding veines about the ſaid Recipient, it is a token that the volatile Spirit begins to manifeſt it ſelf abundantly, and that you muſt then go on ſlowly and avoid all precipitancy and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſte, for the Recipient grows hot by the heat of the vapours and the afflux of the Spirits. The clear drops laſt about four or five hours, the green and firſt volatile vapours as much. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, you muſt begin to encreaſe and urge the fire, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient will totally fill it ſelf with very white vapors, which will continue increaſing ſtill the fire more and more the ſpace of five or ſix houres, and towards the end by the intenſe and vehement action of the fire, yellow drops will fall, which by little and little will turn to a redneſſe, which is an abſolute token of the end of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170969:262"/>the operation, laſting for the moſt part twelve or fifteen houres, according to the greater or leſſer quantity of matter in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort. The veſſels being grown cold, take off the Lute, joyning the Recipient to the Retort, and pour the yellowiſh Spirit, which hath a ſtrong ſulphureous ſmell in a Cucurbite; which having placed in <hi>B. M.</hi> and luted exactly a Still-head to it, as alſo the Matraſs, which is to be applyed to the noſe of the Limbeck, give a fire proportionable to the volatility of the matter; for this Spirit ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth as eaſily and nimbly as ſpirit of Wine; but the fire about the end muſt be a little more urg'd, and the whole ſubſtance will aſcend leaving a dry bottom into a volatile and very penetrating Spirit, poſſeſſing more vertues then can be expreſſed, whether us'd as a bare Remedy, or as a preparation to other Medicaments; this noble Spirit opening and diſſolving bodies without corroſion or alteration of their ſeminal powers and faculties, and that which is more ſurprizing and above all to be admired is, that this Noble and Wonderful Spirit keeps the ſame vertue in Phyſick, and the ſame diſſolutive faculty, after it hath ſerved to the diſſolution and preparation of many different ſubſtances, either Stones or Metals. We will not affirm nevertheleſs, or contend that this Spirit remains unalterable: But this we can, that the experience we have had hitherto, has never diſcovered unto us that he can loſe any part of his acting faculty: contrariwiſe having drawn it off by diſtillation, it hath ever kept in our hands the ſame ſtrength and vigor it had done before, either us'd upon the ſame matter or upon another, as thoſe will moſt certainly finde that ſhall employ it in their operations. It is a ſoveraign Remedy againſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſies of what kind ſoever, Apoplexy, all irritations of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all Hypocondriack and melancholy Diſeaſes, inveterated griefs and pains in the head, and all ſcorbutick maladies; It is admirable fron j. drop to x. in appropriated Liquors; but the moſt judicious Doſis in all Liquors is to a pleaſant acidity.

                           <p>Lead is the vileſt and moſt abject of all Metals, conſiſting of an indigeſted Sulphur, an aluminous ſalt more then vitriolick, and a Mercury coming very near the nature of Antimony. It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Saturn,</hi> by reaſon of the ſympathy it hath with that Celeſtial Planet, as alſo its relation to the Spleen, which is called <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Microcoſm,</hi> to which it is dedicated. Lead is generally aſtringent, cooling and thickening, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It reſtores fleſh about Wounds and Ulcers, and cicatrizeth them; it cools the Venerean heats, and quenches amorous fires, appeaſes the pains and heat of Ulcers, and diſſolves Tumors occaſioned by ſeroſities lurking between the skin and the body. But all this is nothing in reſpect of the vertues it is endowed with, when it is well and artificially opened and prepared by the operations of Chymiſtry, as it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear hereunder.</p>

                           <p>AS we have ſtill begun by the purification of Mixts upon which our work was intended, ſo muſt we more particularly take care of the purgation of Lead, ſince it is the courfeſt and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Metals; wherefore, when Artiſts will employ it in any O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, they muſt before all things melt it in an Iron pot, and when it is in full fuſion, throw upon it by intervals ſmall pieces of Wax, which inſenſibly will waſte away, and when he ſeeth the Lead bright and with a fair aſpect, and to be very clear under the uppermoſt or ſpecifical skim, let him remove the ſaid skim, and throw it in clean water, to put afterwards to ſuch uſes as he intends.</p>
                           <p>This Lead ſo purified muſt be reduced into calx, if you intend to extract the vertue of it; for though this Metal be ſoft and of eaſie fuſion, yet muſt it be calcined to be opened, not only to advance the operation of ſuch Menſtruums as ſhall be made uſe of, but alſo that the extracted ſubſtance may be ſo much more efficacious and full of vertue. This Calcination is perform'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wayes: for there is an incineration, which reduces Lead to gray aſhes or calx, which is brought to paſſe only by ſtirring melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lead in an earthen pot made red hot in the fire. There is moreover a Reverberatory Calcination, when this firſt Calx is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberated in a Reverberatory Furnace with flaming fire, ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered nevertheleſſe that it ſhould not melt; and when the Calx hath chang'd colour and begins to grow yellow, it becomes a fit colour for Painters, which they call <hi>Macicot;</hi> but if it goes to the height of an Orange red, it is called <hi>Minium</hi> in the ſhops. The third Calcination is that which is performed in the purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gold and Silver by the Cupel, where the Lead which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains and flyes not away in vapours, is calcin'd and changed as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a yellow, red or white skin or froth, which is called <hi>Lytharg.</hi> The fourth is the Cementatory Calcination, which is performed by cutting pieees of ſheet or tally Lead, and ſtratifying them with Brimſtone, and calcining it afterwards, as we have ſhewed of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170969:266"/>and when the calcined Lead is waſhed, dryed and reduced to powder, it is that which in ſhops is called <hi>Plumbum uſtum,</hi> or burn'd and calcin'd Lead. The fifth and laſt calcination of Lead, is that which they call <hi>Vaporous Calcination,</hi> which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſuſpending plates of Lead upon a Spirit or ſharp Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, the vapour whereof doth by degrees calcine the Lead, and reduces it into that ſubſtance which is called <hi>white Lead</hi> or <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſs.</hi> The Artiſt muſt chuſe of all theſe Calx's of Lead which he likes beſt to prepare the following Remedies: but he muſt not deliberate or ſtick at taking thoſe which by the action of fire are more open, ſuch as are <hi>Minium</hi> and <hi>Lytharg,</hi> ſince he ſhall much better therewith attain his deſired ends. We will firſt teach to prepare well the Liquor and <hi>ſalt</hi> of <hi>Saturn,</hi> which is alſo called its <hi>Sugar,</hi> by reaſon of its aluminous ſweetneſſe, as alſo the <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>true Magiſtery,</hi> the <hi>Cremor,</hi> butter, or <hi>nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum of Saturn,</hi> the <hi>Balſam of Saturn,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit, yellow and red oyle of Saturn;</hi> all which proceſſes and manner of working we will deliver one after the other.</p>

This Precipitate muſt be waſht to a ſweetneſs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon water; and the laſt time with very good Roſe water, and dryed afterwards gently; it is a very fair white for Pomatums, which may alſo be us'd in Salves and Collyrie's, for it is an excellent deſicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, acting gently and inoffenſively.</p>

It is a ſoveraign Remedy againſt breaking of the skin by bruiſes or otherwiſe, Itch, Scab, inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Boils, Botches, Eriſipela's; for beſides that it doth dry powerfully, it deads alſo and mortifies the ill Ferment which is in the part, and cauſes all the irritations and accidents thereof; it doth wonders againſt burnings, and to allay the grief of hot Gouts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving any occaſion to fear it ſhould ſtrike the humour in by the pretended coldneſs which is attributed unto it; contrariwiſe it may be uſed with confidence, ſince all the Remedies taken out of Lead do work by the ſubtilty of their parts, and reſolve all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities; as alſo kill and mortifie all the acidity, malignant and preternatural acrimony which cauſes the tenſion, inflammation and grief of the parts.</p>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170969:269"/>veines; wherefore as ſoon as this ſign doth appear, the Recipient muſt be changed. The phlegm follows after the yellow oyle, in ſtraight and direct veines, and the red and ſlow oyle remaines in the bottom of the Retort.</p>
                           <p>The volatile ſpirit of ♄ is a wonderful Sudorifick; wherefore it is excellent againſt the Plague, Madneſs, Palſie, Epilepſie and remainders of Apoplexy, afflicting the body or mind, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times both, as alſo in malignant and burning Feavers and Pox; the Doſis muſt be from iiij. drops to xx. in Decoctions, or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters appropriated to the nature of the Diſeaſe.</p>

                           <p>TIN is the ſecond Metal of the laſt form, and one of the leſs noble, though it hath many good qualities, both for Phyſick and Metallick. It is a white and ſoft Metal ſhining with a bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs mixt with ſome blackiſh gloomineſs, conſiſting of a more pure Mercury then that of the hard Metals, but ſofter and more volatile; it is nevertheleſs more fixt then that of Lead, and hath a white undigeſted and unripe ſulphur; this Metal hath very little of ſalt, which is for the moſt part the bond and union between the Mercury and Sulphur of Bodies, whence proceeds its poroſity
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170969:270"/>and harſhneſs. Hermetical Philoſophers call it ♃ <hi>Jupiter,</hi> by reaſon of its congruity with that Plant, in the great World, and the virtual ſympathy it hath by the Remedies extracted from it with the Liver and Womb, to whom it is particularly dedicated in Man the little World.</p>
                           <p>It is not neceſſary for us here to repeat unneceſſarily the manner of extracting the ſalt, and making the falſe and true Magiſtery of ♃ <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſince it is the ſame way we have taught upon ♄. We are only to give notice, that the calx of ♃ muſt be Reverberated, taking it as it is already prepared for Potters to uſe, and that the ſpace of two dayes, whereby to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it as it is fitting; otherwiſe very little ſalt will come of it. The Salt and true Magiſtery are ſpecifical Remedies and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar againſt ſuffocations and fits of the Mother, which are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully allayd by it, whether adminiſtred inwardly, or outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applyed. They are alſo admirable Topicals for the cure of putrid, ſtinking, hollow, fiſtulous and cancerous Ulcers, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Wolves. The Doſis inwardly taken is from j. <hi>gr.</hi> to vj. in Bolus, in ſome Conſerve of Balme, or Flowers of Peny-Royal, the ſpirit of Elder-berries, or ſpirit of Karabe or yellow Amber. But let the Artiſt be very wary, in purging thoſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that have made uſe of this Remedy, with ſome gentle and convenient Purgation which irritates not the Womb; otherwiſe he muſt begin a new. Wherefore let him have a ſpecial care, not to ſtir the ſeroſity of this dangerous Animal, after it is once quieted and laid aſleep by the eradiating vertue of the metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or mineral Sulphurs; and as he knows and is ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, that the Anodyne vertue proceeds from this (Mineral) Family, let him make uſe of purgative Remedies, and thoſe Diuretical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Diaphoretical preparations which it doth ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully yield, and that have neither ſmell nor taſte, that can irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and provoke afreſh this delicate and tickliſh part.</p>

                           <p>WEE are engaged to give here the manner of an operation upon ♃ which contains ſeveral very uſeful Remedies, and very conſiderable obſervations, whether in reſpect of the work, or of the matters which are made uſe of, and whereby the Artiſt may be taught to penetrate further into the knowledge of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other and better things, whileſt he is in the way towards this.</p>
                           <p>℞ ℥ iiij. of very ſmall filed Tin, and being mixt in a Marble mortar with <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> xij. of corroſive ſublimate Mercury, put this powder in a Retort with a very large neck, and having placed it in ſand, about half an inch thick upon the bottom of the Diſh that contains it, give it a convenient fire, and you ſhall firſt draw a Spirit continually ſmoaking; then afterwards it will yield a Butter, or a kind of corroſive Icy Oyle. And in the third place, the Mercury will be revivifyed or quickened again abundantly, being no longer ſtayd or coagulated by the ſpirits of thoſe ſalts which have forſaken it, to work upon the body of the Tin; this done, encreaſe the fire downwards, and give it a fire of ſuppreſſion, and all the ſubſtance of ♃ will aſcend in the neck of the Retort, under the form of a gray Gum very hard, ſo that in the bottom will remain very few red feces; reduce immediately this Gum into powder, otherwiſe it would quickly grow moiſt in the ayr, and put it in a Cellar upon a ſheet of white Lattin, being edged about, and a ſmall gutter or mouth, by which the moiſtneſſe and coolneſſe of the Cellar having reduced it into a yellow Oyle, it may run and be received in a Diſh of glaſs or ſtone metal, fitted under the ſame to be as a Recipient. This Oyle in Chyrurgery is an admirable Medicine to eat up proud fleſh, and the hard or thick skin of Ulcers; but the Surgeon muſt handle it with dexterity and judgement; for it muſt only be applyed with a Pencil very gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by reaſon of its penetrating ſubtility, though it be not ſo corroſive as the Butter which comes forth after the Spirit; and is a true Cauſtick that muſt alſo be us'd with diſcretion, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170969:271"/>to hinder the progreſs of ſome dangerous gangrening, and to make Iſſues or ſudden Cauteries; as likewiſe to accelerate the exſoliation of Bones, and the ſeparation of rotten parts and the Exoſtoſes cauſed by Nodus's in the Pox. But there may be an excellent <hi>jovial Diaphoretical</hi> made out of this oyle or Butter, diſſolving it with diſtilled Rain-water; for as you ſhall be ſtirring, and the water ſhall diſſolve the Salts of the corroſive Sublimate which kept the Tin in diſſolution, it will immediately fall and precipitate it ſelf in a white powder in the bottom of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, which muſt be dryed and edulcorated, and you ſhall have in it no deſpicable Diaphoretick; which may be adminiſtred from ij. <hi>gr.</hi> to viij in Conſerves, Confections or Preſerves, or in appropriated Waters or Spirits, for ſuch as are troubled with ſuperfluous ſeroſities, and chiefly in accidents and caſes of the great Pox; as likewiſe moſt ſpecially for Women troubled with ſlackneſs or too much moiſtneſs of the Womb. And as we have often ſaid, that the Chymical Artiſt muſt be cautious not to loſe or waſte any of the ſubſtances he prepares; but contrariwiſe, muſt know them throughly as much as it is poſſible, to be capable to employ them uſefully according to the vertue which is in them; he muſt take that red matter, which after diſtillation is found in the bottom of the Retort, and join it with what remains after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Gum in a Cellar upon a leaf or plate of white Latin, which are nothing elſe but the ſulphur and ſalt of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury and Tin; the ſeparation whereof he is to make by the help of diſtilled Rain-water, which diſſolving the ſalt, the ſulphur ſinks downward, the liquor whereof is to be ſeparated, filtrated and evaporated in ſalt, which diſſolve again, filtrate and coagulate, and thus continue until it be clear, fair and green as an Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald; as for the Sulphur, it muſt be edulcorated, dryed gently, and kept for uſe. The Salt is diuretical and aperitive, and is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred from j. <hi>gr.</hi> to iiij. in Broth or white Wine, to cleanſe the Womb and thoſe parts which have any relation to it. The Sulphur is a good Sudorifick and Anodyne. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis from j. <hi>gr.</hi> or φ to <hi>gr.</hi> iij. in Emulſions made with the ſeeds of Lemon, <hi>Carduus Benedictus</hi> or holy Thiſtle, and white Poppy with Cordial Waters; it is a ſpecifick Remedy for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men troubled with diſeaſes of the Mother; the Spirit alwayes
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170969:271"/>ſteeming, which was the firſt drawn, is alſo a very ſtrange ſubſtance; for beſides that it will not be kept in by any Veſſel, without yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually white vapours, and without any ſenſible dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of its weight or vertue; it is ſo active, ſubtile and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating, that it ſtops and pets at a ſtand, not only Gangrenes and Wolves, the offending parts being only rub'd with it, but even can hinder the progreſſe and running of the Sphacelus which is a rottenneſſe of the bones; in which Cure, it goes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven beyond the water of Quick-lime, whereof we have ſpoken, and taught the making above. Beſides all what we have ſaid, there is a Noble Preparation yet to be made with this Spirit; which is, to take as much as you will of it, and put it in a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſs broad at the neck, and ſoftly by little and little and by intervals pour upon it Tincture of ſalt ♀, immediately will riſe a fermentation with ſeveral bubbles, which break with ſome kind of noiſe and ſmoak or ſteem; you muſt go on in pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Tincture till the noiſe and bubbles do ceaſe; place afterwards the Veſſel in warm aſhes, and the matter will turn into a coagulated ſubſtance black as pitch, to which giving a fire of ſublimation, you ſhall have white Chryſtals melting as Wax, which are a very good cure of ſcrophulous and cancerous Ulcers, as alſo any ill remainders of the Pox, becauſe they cauterize almoſt without pain to the very bottom of the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and cauſe the ſeparation of dead fleſh or ſcarre, leaving the Ulcer without malignity, which muſt afterwards be filled with the Balſam of Sulphur, and the <hi>Plaiſter of Rullandus</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Diaſulphuris.</hi> With this we put an end to Metals, to come to Minerals which are next kin to them.</p>

                           <p>MERCURY is a mineral volatile Liquor, which gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſticks to Metals, and above all to Gold. It is alſo called <hi>Quick-filver,</hi> and ſometimes found running and pure in Mines, but very ſeldom; for it is for the moſt part drawn by Revivification from a mineral Earth, vulgarly called <hi>Cinnabar.</hi> The choice of it is much to be heeded, becauſe it is not equally good, but accordingly proves more or leſs uſeful in Chymical O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations; for Mercury may hold ſomething of the foulneſs and impurity of his Matrix, which is the place of its formation and original, either by reaſon of the earthly Recrements and other filth which do pollute and defile it, or by reaſon of ſome impure mixture, or amalgamation and ſophiſticating of the Merchants who uſe to ſell it.</p>
                           <p>As for the choice to be made of it by reaſon of its original, that which grows near Mines of the moſt pure and noble Metals,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170969:272"/>and chiefly thoſe of Gold, is to be preferred; wherefore that which comes from <hi>Spain</hi> and from the Mines of <hi>Hungary,</hi> is ever to be choſen before any other. The matters which naturally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and deprave Mercury, are Arſenick, Antimony, Lead and Cadmia; but there is beſides an artificial Sophiſtication, very hard to be diſcovered and diſcerned, either by ſight or weight; for it is mixt with ſome part of Lead or Biſmuthum, ſqueezed through Leather, ſo as nothing remains behind; yet this Cheat may be diſcovered and found out two ſeveral wayes: the firſt by diſtilling it in a Retort; for if no dregs or impurity remains in the bottom of it, it is a ſign that the Quick-ſilver is pure; the ſecond is by evaporating of it in a ſilver Spoon in open fire; for if the Mercury leaves only a yellowiſh or white ſpot, it is a ſign of its purity; but if it leaves a brown, black or obſcure, it is a ſign of its foulneſs, and of being ſophiſticated. There are yet nevertheleſs ſome other wayes of depurating it wholly, which we will place amongſt the preparations of Mercury.</p>
                           <p>The general vertues of it cannot very well be deſcribed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not yet been ſufficiently tryed; for it may be ſaid with truth, that they never were yet diſcovered by any to the bottom: thus much nevertheleſs may be ſaid, that Mercury is an internal cleanſer or Mundificative of the whole maſſe of the blood, and that it expels from it whatſoever the depravation of digeſtion and evil fermentation may have contracted and mixed in it of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and hurtful humours; but particularly it cleanſeth the body from the venomous infection of the Pox; kills and expels worms, advances and haſtens difficult birth; but in outward applications cures all manner of Scabs and Itch, deſtroyes all manner of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, and diſſolves hard ſwellings and Tumors; hung to the neck, it is a preſervative from Plague; and ſome are even of opinion that it may hinder Witchcraft, Charms and Incantations; final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it may be ſaid with much reaſon, that except it be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, there is no ſubſtance under the Sun of ſo general a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, nor yielding ſo many different Remedies againſt all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; for it ſupplyes us with Vomitives, Purgatives, Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Lenitives, as it will appear when we come to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larize the ſeveral deſcriptions, and the ſeveral proceſſes and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations incident to the preparation thereof. But we muſt
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170969:273"/>advertiſe our Artiſt, that Quick-ſilver is called ♀ <hi>Mercury,</hi> by reaſon of the correſpondence which is between that Planet and this ſemi-Metal; and that as <hi>Mercury</hi> is an inconſtant and changing Planet, ſo likewiſe this Mineral makes himſelf all to all, hot with the hot, cold with the cold ſubſtances, and ſo of the reſt. Some give it the Rule of, and place it over the Lungs; and others ſubject unto it the inferiour Ventricle, as alſo the uppermoſt or whole belly: but I hold of a more univerſal Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and ſay, that I believe Mercury univerſally to work upon all man's body, and to drive away generally all Diſeaſes and griefs from it, of what nature ſoever; ſince we ſee that Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies taken from Mercury are a cure of Leproſie and Pox, which are diſeaſes and a corruption of the whole ſubſtance.

Begin your fire at firſt ſlowly, and encreaſe by degrees until the whole Mercury be changed, calcined or precipitated into a red powder as mineral <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> very bright, ſhining and ſparkling to the eye. Digeſt it the ſpace of three weeks with alkohol of Wine, and kindle it ſeven times over, by which the concoction and fixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it will be perfected; it is an univerſal Mercurial Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt all Agues, but particularly a true Specifick againſt the Pox
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170969:274"/>which it radically cures, if it be adminiſtred ſeven times to the Patient to provoke ſweating, for it is an infallible Sudorifick; it kills alſo the wormes in the ſtomach, and thoſe which are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in the Guts and Inteſtines. The Doſis muſt be from ij. <hi>gr.</hi> to viij. in ſome Conſerve, Confection or Cordial Extract; the Patient muſt keep his bed when he uſes it, and muſt take care of being well covered, expecting patiently till the ſweating comes, which will not fail to bring along with it the hoped for and deſired ſucceſs.

                           <p>THere is no need here to repeat any thing of the manner of the Veſſel: we only adviſe our Artiſt to note that he may make this operation, as alſo the foregoing in a plain Matraſs, without making uſe of a Hell: for that kind of Veſſel being rare, it would put a needleſs difficulty and rub upon the Work; Yet let the Matraſs however be flat and plain in the bottom, and ſtopt in the mouth only with a wooden pin which may eaſily be taken away, to throw down again the Mercury which may have raiſed its ſelf by ſublimating into the neck of the Veſſel. We have no more to do here then to add the Doſes of the Metals which are intended to be added to the Mercury, to communicate unto it ſome other vertue then that it hath already from it ſelf: for as we have ſaid, there may be gold or ſilver added, or both together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If it be gold alone, after it hath been three times purg'd by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, it muſt be made into an Amalgam with viij. p. of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury purified, and this Amalgam put in the Veſſel and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted,

What change and alteration doth it not produce in mans body being only applyed outwardly in Frictions, Perfumes and Plaiſters? What doth it not perform in Baths? What ſtrange effects doth it not produce in Pills? and all this whileſt yet cloyed with a Body, or only altered by the intervention of ſalts and ſpirits; What then may not be hoped from it, when it is brought to a further digeſtion, and turned to a liquid ſpirituous ſubſtance which may be mixed with potable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors! for then it is capable to be volatiliz'd by natural heat, and its vertue brought from the Center to the Circumference, and ſo penetrates all parts and carries along with it by ſweat, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver impurities and evil humours it meets with, whether a matter ripe for Diſeaſes, or only a ſuperfluity of digeſtions. But to ſtop the mouths of the Detractors and obſtinate unbelievers, I finde my ſelf obliged to relate here the Hiſtory of a Perſon eminent both in condition and place, who is yet living; having been actually blind in former time, and now cured by a Mercurial Remedy, yet in powder, and not brought to the perfection of a Spirit; and that which is more to be conſidered in this cure, is, that there was no other Remedy us'd but of one grain and half of this prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Mercury blown with a Quill in the Noſtrils, which in a very ſhort time did produce ſurpriſing effects! for his Head ſwell'd in an extraordinary manner; then did he ſpit, drivel, ſhed tears, blow his Noſe, ſneeze, vomit, piſſe, had copious and large ſtools, &amp; ſweated likewiſe, and all this in leſſe then eight hours; after which thoſe violent ſymptomes did ceaſe, and relent by degrees. But that which is more wonderful, is, that the very next day he began to ſee, though ſomewhat confuſedly, and from day to day after that, began to diſtinguiſh objects, and finally was totally cured, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170969:282"/>joyes now one of the beſt and ſteadieſt eye-ſights a man can have, and ſince that hath performed many remarkable ſervices to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> The ſame Perſon which cured him, did alſo cure the moſt deſperate Pocks with the fame Remedy, given in the ſame quantity, and blown in the Noſtrils. Where is now (I beſeech you) that Medicine that ſhall produce the like effects, even at a great diſtance? This Relation is ſo true, that to juſtifie it, I can produce many a witneſſe of Credit and Repute; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think no body ſhall judge it more ſtrange, that I ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the foregoing preparations, vertues and effects of far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour difficulty and worth; which makes me conclude here in a profound admiration of the ſupream Wiſdome, and with ſcorn of humane ignorance, ſaying, That the age of Man is too ſhort to go through the exact Anatomy of Mercury, and draw all the noble Remedies which God and Nature have placed in this Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roclit and neutral Mixt, which hath not its like in all created ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances or ſublunary Beings.</p>

                           <head>Of Antimony and its Chymical Preparation.</head>
                           <p>AS Antimony is the ſtumbling ſtone of many of thoſe which profeſſe Phyſick, and they that are not acquainted with it, will traduce it as the vain Idol of Chymiſts and Chymiſtry; ſo muſt we with all poſſible endeavour make it appear, that it is with very juſt reaſon and good purpoſe, that Artiſts have Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in eſteem, ſince it is grounded upon their knowledge of its nature, they having not, as the Traducers and Diſſamators there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of do, been contented with the Rind and ſuperficial examination of the ſame; but contrariwiſe, having opened and anatomized it, to extract thoſe wonderful Remedies which daily do produce ſuch noble effects, to the great praiſe and exaltation of Chymiſtry, and the diſcredit of thoſe who publiquely profeſſe their defaming by invectives, and ridiculous calumnies againſt ſuch as daily uſe it with skill and knowledge, order and Method, and conſequently with deſired ſucceſs.</p>
                           <p>But to clear more this truth which we have laid, we muſt in few words declare the nature of Antimony, and of what ſubſtance it is made of, to make it obvious and plain, and evident to the leaſt capacity, that thoſe that have an averſion and hatred for it, do on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemn it for want of true knowledge, both of the ſubſtance and firſt preparation thereof, as we will declare in the ſequel of this Diſcourſe.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Antimony</hi> then is nothing elſe but a Marcaſſite, mean or mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Mineral, which nature had deſtined to a metallick production; but hath fainted in the way, want of not having in it ſelf the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary diſpoſitions to attain to that perfection; or becauſe it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturely ſnatcht away and torn off from its matrix, as an unripe fruit pluckt off from the tree; or finally, by reaſon of the terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial impurity of its mixture, and the diſproportion and indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of its principles.</p>
                           <pb n="223" facs="tcp:170969:285"/>
                           <p>But to let the Reader better underſtand, this we ſay, let the Artiſt know, that Antimony doth firſt of all conſiſt of a mineral ſulphur, partly very pure and anſwering the nature of that of Gold, whoſe foundation is in its redneſſe and is fix; and it is in the center of this Solar ſulphur that all the wonders of Antimony are placed; the other part of this ſulphur is impure, diſſipable by fire, and volatile as common Brimſtone, and to this Sulphur are commonly referred and attributed the violent and raging opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when it is not well and duly corrected, or ill and negligently ſeparated. Secondly, This Mineral is compounded of a metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Mercury in abundance, which is nevertheleſſe indigeſted and ſuliginous; but yet more concocted and coagulated then quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, becauſe it participates of the Saturnine nature: finally, the third conſtituting part or principle of our Antimony, is a groſs and earthly ſubſtance which it holds from its matrix, containing very little of ſenſible ſalt, though ſalt was the firſt cauſe of its production: but the nature of it is chang'd by reaſon of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral alterations and diſguiſes it hath ſuffered by the concoction and digeſtion of its centrical fire.</p>
                           <p>By which deſcription of Antimony and its conſtituting parts is plain to be ſeen, that it is nothing elſe but a gathering and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Vitriol, Sulphur and Mercury of the nature of Lead met together, and that by conſequence it cannot be dangerous or condemnable in it ſelf, ſince every day theſe three ſubſtances are uſed by themſelves, and taken apart in Phyſick, either as they grow naturally, or prepared; and wherefore then ſhould not crude and prepared Antimony be made uſe of alſo? But it will be objected unto me, That the moſt famous and celebrated Authors which have written of Antimony, call it <hi>a Poyſon,</hi> and ſay, that it doth participate of ſome mixture of Realgar and Arſenick; To which we anſwer, that Lead, Quick-ſilver and Brimſtone, participate alſo of the ſame mixture, and yet are not baniſhed from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of Phyſick: ſince even Realgar and Arſenick are made uſe of, after the malignancy of their ſalt and ſulphur hath been corrected by the miniſtery of fire, and of the ſpirits that are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of this operation, ſo that they may be inwardly adminiſtred, ſupplying us alſo with the beſt Topical Remedies againſt all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and malignant Ulcers. But it is quite otherwiſe of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170969:286"/>which daily is adminiſtred by the mouth wholly raw, and without any accident even to ſucking Children: and moreover, made to boyl in the weight of <abbr>lb</abbr> 
                              <hi>ſs.</hi> in Decoctions againſt the Pocks, and alſo put in cold infuſion of water to open the body and remove obſtructions in the Entrails. Let then our Artiſt know, that when ever Ancient or Modern Authors which have treated concerning Antimony, have ſaid it was a Poyſon, it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood only comparatively between the common preparations of Antimony not yet ſufficiently corrected, and ſo conſequently cauſing violent Vomits and Stools, with thoſe they deſcribe that are harmleſſe and of no danger, but which only do ſtrengthen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and help it to expel inſenſibly whatever is noxious and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to it. Wherefore let us conclude this ſmall preliminary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Antimony, by the words which <hi>Zwelferus</hi> hath to this purpoſe in the Appendix inſerted to the end of his Notes upon the <hi>Pharmacopea of Aufburg,</hi> in praiſe of this noble Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and againſt the unlearned and ignorant Deſpiſers thereof. <hi>Cum ſtibij vel antimonij nomen apud aliquos artis pulcherrima o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſores, praeſertim ignorantes, tam malè audiat, ut qui ſolummodò ore illud excidere permittit, mox ex medentium coetu proſcriptus ad veneficos amandetur; quia tamen hoc de antimonio judicium, non in alia officina, quam cerebri ad Lunae creſcentis &amp; de creſcentis mutabilitatem tornati excuditur; &amp; vix alius de eo magis perversè &amp; perfricta fronte loquitur, quàm qui minimam ejus habet cognitionem; Idoirco nullo canum ſimilium hoc ſidus allatrantium, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitio à veri tramite dimotus, hoc in praeſens aſſerere non erubeſco: antimonium verè unam &amp; principalem eſſe columnam univerſae Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinae; Quipè ex eo tanquam Proteo, diverſis duntaxat praepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus, dioerſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </p>
                           <p>All Authors are agreed that the <hi>Hungarian Antimony,</hi> or <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvanian</hi> is to be choſen for the nobleſt and higheſt operations, becauſe it is the pureſt, and participates more of the Solar nature, and ſo its internal ſulphur is much more exalted. It is found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs in many other places, and chiefly in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> hath ſome which is not altogether deſpicable. So that thoſe which cannot come at that Antimony which is digged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout golden Mines, muſt take and chuſe in lieu of it to ſupply their work, a clear, pure and ſhining Antimony, with clear and bright faces or glittering flawes: if it be mineral, mixt with a kind of changing and playing colour, as that in Doves necks, or the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Opal or the Rainbow, which are all ſignes of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy and abundance of its ſulphur: but if it be common
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170969:287"/>Antimony that hath beem melted already, that which has the longeſt ſtreakes or ſhining and ſparkling lines, or flawes with the ſames notes of colour, which we have recommended in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is to be preferred. They that will try it further to be ſurer of it, muſt take <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. of Antimony made into very ſmall powder, and temper or ſprinkle it with very good ſpirit of Vinegar; then let it dry or evaporate in the fire upon a ſmall Iron plate, or ſome ſmall piece of an earthen pot, with this caution neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, neither to flow, or melt in the fire: and if the powder remaines of a red colour, it is an aſſured ſign of the goodneſſe and abundance of its ſulphur. But we hold the <hi>beſt tryal of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony</hi> to be its reduction into Regulus by the help of <hi>Mars</hi> and Niter, without any mixture of Tartar, by reaſon of its Alkali which diſſolves ſulphurs: for that which yields the greateſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Regulus and the pureſt, is the beſt, ſince the Regulus is nothing elſe but a well purified Antimony.</p>

                           <p>The <hi>general preparations</hi> then made upon Antimony, are: Firſt, <hi>Calcination;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>Sublimation;</hi> thirdly, <hi>Diſtillation;</hi> fourthly, <hi>Liquation</hi> or <hi>Reſolution;</hi> fifthly, <hi>Extraction;</hi> ſixthly, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion;</hi> ſeventhly, <hi>Salification;</hi> ſome do add in the eighth place,

                              <hi>Mercurification:</hi> but we will omit that, having made a hundred ſucceſſeſſe trials, by which we could never be convinced of the truth thereof; wherefore we abſtain from it upon the ſame account, and for the ſame reaſon we have hinted, ſpeaking of the mercury of Metals; and further, knowing full well that <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, underſtand nothing elſe by the <hi>mercury of Antimony,</hi> then its well prepared <hi>Regulus,</hi> without any diminution or loſs of its So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or Central ſulphur, though we deny not the poſſibility thereof: But we will impoſe upon no body, nor be the cauſe of any loſſe of time upon Proceſſes and Operations that have never, nor never ſhall hit or ſucceed right. The <hi>Calcination</hi> is twofold, dry and moiſt: the dry yields the Glaſſe, Crocus or Saffron, Diaphoretick Remedies and Regulus; the moiſt gives the Precipitates. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation makes the Flowers, Cinnabar or Vermilion. The Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation drawes Vinegars, Oyles and Spirits. Extraction commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates Sulphurs and Tinctures. Infuſion gives emetical Wines and Ophthalmical Waters; and the Salification, Salt.</p>

                           <head>The particular preparations of Antimony, and how the Glaſs of Antimony is to be made by plain distillation.</head>
                           <p>THere are ſo many deſcriptions of the manner of preparing the Glaſs of Antimony, that Artiſts are confounded in this particular, and hardly know how to chuſe the beſt: but as we are ſufficiently inſtructed, both by Theory and practice, that the beſt is that which is made without addition or mixture, we will exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie and propound for a pattern the preparation of this, becauſe whoſoever can perform it exactly, ſhall never be put to ſeek in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the others, the melting, clarification, and diaphaneity whereof is much eaſier, by reaſon of the union of ſeveral ſalts, by which the fluxion is ſacilitated and becomes both quicker and cleanlier; this Glaſs without addition is thus made.</p>
                           <p>Take well choſen Antimony, and being made into very ſmall powder, calcine it in a very large and capacious earthen Diſh, not glazed or varniſhed, upon a ſlow fire, ſtirring continually with an Iron Spatula or Slice; this Calcination is to be made in a place where the ayr may freely paſſe thorow, and the Artiſt muſt ſtand
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170969:288"/>above the wind, that he may receive no inconveniency by the vapours exhaling from the pure ſulphur of Antimony, nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe or ſuffocate his breaſt; above all things great care muſt be had not to make too big a fire, otherwiſe the excrementitious moiſture being too ſuddenly driven away, the melting and vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication thereof would be hindered; after you have kept this Antimony three or four houres upon the fire, and that you ſhall ſee it begin to crumble it ſelf and gather up together, draw the Veſſel off from the fire, and pour the matter upon a Porphyry ſtone, whereafter it is grown cold you may reduce it into alkohol; then begin anew to calcine with a little more fire then at the firſt time, and thus proceed three or four times, encreaſing ſtill the fire at every time that you bray your Antimony, and you will have an antimonial Calx of a whitiſh gray, which you may uſe to make your Glaſs therewith; as alſo to prepare an excellent Diaphoretick againſt the Plague and malignant Feavers: to attain to this, Reverberate part of this calx in a Crucible in open fire, until from white it turns to yellow; and if the calx do happen to crumble during the Reverberation, take it immediately off from the fire, and bray it again, and thus go on until all the external ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur be evaporated, and the internal begins to appear and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt its ſelf by its yellow colour, which it yields when it is come to this paſs; put it in a Matraſs, and pour upon it very good ſpirit of Wine, and digeſt them together the ſpace of fifteen dayes, which being over, kindle of this ſpirit ſeven time upon your Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretick to fix it the better.

                           <p>WEE will give three deſcriptions of this Operation: the firſt more ſlight, common and eaſie; the other ſomething more intricate, and the third more laborious; that as the work and preparation of it is various, and for different reaſons, ſo the Artiſt may be inſtructed in the one and the other, to be the more capable thereby to ſatisfie himſelf and others.</p>

                           <p>WEE have in general recommended to the Artſt, to have a ſpecial care of the choice and purity of his materials: but he muſt be more circumſpect then ever in all the Antimonial O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, becauſe from thence depends very much, as alſo from his prudence and knowledge, the good or the bad ſucceſſe of his Operation.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore let him take well choſen Antimony, and well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purated Salt-peter to make all the following preparations: for as Niter is called <hi>the Soap of the wiſe,</hi> ſo muſt it be pure and clean to perform that cleanſing, and that action which Authors hope to finde in it. ℞. then well choſen Antimony and well purified Sulphur <hi>ana</hi> equal parts, beat them to powder each apart, then mix and put them in a braſs Mortar covered with an earthen-pot cover, or with a round Tile, having a hole in it of the bigneſſe of a Thumb in diameter, through which it may be ſet on fire with a ſmall kindled coal; this Operation which is called <hi>Fulguration, Fulmination</hi> and <hi>Detonation,</hi> muſt be made in an open place, and you muſt get agove the wind, leſt you be overcome by the ſmoak which is noiſome and dangerous, by reaſon of the corroſion of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170969:289"/>the nitrous Spirit, and the inflammation of the external ſulphur of Antimony. When the Mortar is grown cold, draw off the matter from it which will be of two kinds: the uppermoſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating of Salt-peter, Sulphur and Antimony; the undermoſt, which is in a compacted and cloſe lump of Liver-colour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling unto it, for which reaſon it is called <hi>Hepar antimonij,</hi> or <hi>Liver of Antimony,</hi> is properly nothing elſe but an inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, imperfect and opacous vitrification of Antimony, by the calcination which the Salt-peter performs in a moment. Theſe two matters are to be put together in a braſs Mortar, and tritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to a ſubtile powder, which muſt be waſhed in warm water, to ſeparate the fatneſs thereof; ſet the firſt Lotion aſide for the uſe we ſhay ſay hereafter, and continuing the trituration, lotion and effuſion of the Liquor loaden with the ſubtileſt powder, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til all the body of this Hepar or Liver of Antimony be transfuſed with the water into an impalpable powder; ſeparate the ſaid wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and dry the powder gently by evaporation, and you ſhall have that which commonly is called <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> or <hi>Saffron of Metals.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If the firſt Lotion be filtrated, and this clear water precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated with diſtilled Vinegar, there falls a red powder in the bottom, which is called <hi>Sulphur auratum diaphoreticum,</hi> diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick golden Sulphur, but very improperly, becauſe it is nothing elſe but a portion of the external ſulphur of Antimony, which the fixt ſalt of the Niter did keep diſſolved and hidden in it ſelf, and has been made corporeal and viſible by the help of the diſtilled vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, becauſe all whatſoever is diſſolved by the ſalts alkali, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated by acid ſpirits; and contrariwiſe, all what is diſſolved by acid ſpirits, is precipitated by alkaly's. But let it not be fancied that this pretended golden Sulphur be Diaphoretick; nor let the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors word be taken for a warrant in this matter: for it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, unleſs you give it in a very ſmall Doſis, which ſhall not work, and if the Doſis be encreaſed it will cauſe exceeding and violent vomiting: for it is nothing elſe but a very ſubtile <hi>Crocus metallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> wherewith many do prepare their Emetical Wine.</p>

                           <p>THis ſecond preparation doth not differ in the matter, it only differs in the work which is ſomething of longer deduction: for you muſt take <abbr>lb</abbr>

This mixture and manner of working is only for this end and reaſon, that the Niter in fluxion mixes &amp; doth unite it ſelf, and penetrates much better the Antimony, then the Niter cold and in powder, and the conflagration or quick burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth carry much better away the impure ſulphur of Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which makes the Crocus Metallorum leſſe violent in its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, ſince all the ill conſequences commonly feared in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, take their riſe from this impure and dangerous Sulphur, to which, though upon ſlight grounds, are attributed the arſenical and venomous vapours of it.</p>

                           <p>It was not without reaſon we have ſaid, that the firſt water wherein the fixed Niter was diſſolved is to be ſet apart; becauſe the nature of this ſalt is altered by the ſulphur of Antimony, and is become of the condition of alkali and lixivial Salt, whoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and eſſence is ſubtile, penetrating and igneous rather then corroſive, which is the reaſon it has diſſolved the pureſt portion of the antimonial Regulus impregnated with its fix and ſolar Sulphur, very well concocted and digeſted by the action of the fire and Niter; and though this water appears clear, yet it hath contracted a weight: wherefore this water muſt be precipitated with diſtilled Vinegar, and it ſhall immediately turn as white as Milk, becauſe the Diaphoretick which was hidden in the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it doth manifeſt it ſelf, and with no unpleaſant ſmell; but contrariwiſe hath the very ſmell of Cream and ſowriſh Whey, whileſt it is edulcorating, and after the deſiccation is made to keep it for uſe; and as we have ſaid, that the precipitate of this Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretick was of a very good ſmell, by reaſon of the fixedneſſe of its internal ſulphur, ſo muſt we make it appear, that that

We have thought neceſſary to ſay ſo much to inform the Sons of Art, that whatſoever muſt fix a ſubſtance, ought ever to be in triple proportion to what is to be fixed; and contrariwiſe, what is to be volatiliz'd, muſt in the ſame proportion be leſſe, then what is to act and work upon it; and ſometimes the proportion is quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated: as ℥ iiij. of ſpirit to volatilize ℥ j. of ſalt, and ℥ iiij. of ſalt to fix ℥ j. of ſpirit; which obſervation paſſes for a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Axiom in Chymiſtry. The Doſis of this Diaphoreticks in Body and groſſe ſubſtance, is from <hi>gr.</hi> iiij. to xxx. and of the Precipitate, from <hi>gr.</hi> iij. to xx. The vertue of both is very eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable and of high value in Phyſick; for though we call them <hi>fixed,</hi> it is only comparatively to other antimonial Remedies which provoke violent Vomitings and Purgation: for the Diaphoretick works by an irradiation of vertue and-efficacy almoſt inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, becauſe it ſtrengthens gently and naturally the internal <hi>Archeus,</hi> which is the principal Director of all the functions of Life, either in health or ſickneſſe: wherefore the uſe of it muſt be continued without interruption during the ſpace of a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical month, becauſe during that time, it is capable to alter and change for the better, whatſoever is hurtful and hinders the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the actions of this principal and real <hi>Archeus.</hi> But if it be applyed and appropriated to particular Diſeaſes, as alſo to parts of the body, we ſhall be bold to ſay, that the Diaphoretical Antimony is an unparalleld Remedy, to reſiſt the corruption which may breed and lurk in the body, mundifying and rectifying the whole maſſe of the blood, and being capable to open the moſt inveterate obſtructions of the Liver, Spleen, Meſentery, Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170969:292"/>and all other parts beſides: it removes the ſtopping of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, cures Green-ſickneſſe, Dropſie, Hypocondrical Melancholy, Pocks and all the accidents thereof; mundifies and cures inward and outward Ulcers, breaks inward Impoſtumes without danger: and finally, is ſingular againſt malignant and ſpotted Feavers, Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and ſmall Pocks. And though this Diaphoretical be a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Remedy, there are ſome nevertheleſſe which think to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularize and render it ſpecifical to certain parts of the Body, and Diſeaſes, adding Metals, as Gold, Silver, Tin, Copper, or Steel to the Antimony, or its Regulus before it be calcined with Niter, and thus pretend to render it Cordial, Cephalick, Stomachick, Splenetick or Hepatick; but our opinion is, that thoſe Metals are not opened enough for this plain antimonial Fuſion, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muicate ſo eaſily their vertue which doth properly lurk in a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral ſulphur, not ſo eaſily extracted; and as Antimony is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, whoſe ſulphur is leſſe cloſe and fixed, let us content our ſelves with what Nature and Art have ſo bountifully ſupplyed us with, and with ſo ample and ſo diffuſed a vertue.</p>

                           <p>WEE have already ſaid above, that the Regulus of Antimony is nothing elſe but depurated Antimony: but that purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ought to be made without Tartar, becauſe the alkali which reſults from the Tartar and Niter is a mixed ſalt, which doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and diſſolve the moſt fix and inward ſulphurs of Mixts, as it appears by the feces and skim ſwimming above the Regulus made with Tartar, which are high in colour, and by the ſmall quantity of Regulus extracted this way. But it may be ſaid, that it is not ſo much the true Artiſt's part to ſeek for quantity as qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and that although he may attain to more by another manner of working, yet ought he to prefer and acquieſce in that which yields leaſt, becauſe it is thought to be more pure and more open. To anſwer this Objection, we muſt lay firſt for a Foundation, that Steel is to be uſed for making of the Regulus, to make it good; that Iron or Steel are capable agents to attract to themſelves the impure and combuſtible ſulphur of Antimony, by reaſon of the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170969:293"/>ſiccity, poroſity, and terreſtreity of the Iron which longs to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf of what he finds to be deſtituted of, attracting it from every ſubject or ſubſtance wherein he can finde it: as we have in ſome manner made manifeſt when we deſcribed the purification of Iron, and the turning of it into Steel, by the help of the fat, volatile and unctuous ſulphur of Ox-hornes. Moreover, Niter doth cauſe a ſudden inflammation, and a fuſion, which raiſes up by an ebullition, and as it were an inſtantaneous fermentation, all the Iron or <hi>Mars,</hi> the terreſtrial impurities and external ſulphur of Antimony, inſomuch as the only Reguline and Mercurial part of Antimony, remaines in fuſion in the bottom of the Crucible, poſſeſſing in it ſelf the fix'd and ſolar Sulphur, which by ſympathy and analogy of ſubſtance hath attracted the ſoul of <hi>Mars,</hi> which is its pure ſulphur. Thus muſt the Artiſt conſider, that in the operation the pure part of the Antimony is preſerved, and that we deprive it of its impurity; and moreover, that we add yet to this part another Sulphur, which hath no leſſe efficacy then that which is contained in it: whereas Tartar never fails to diſſolve and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the pure part and its ſulphur, which muſt of neceſſity be well preſerved, if you will have the other operations reſulting from it, to ſucceed with that vertue and efficacy which is deſired, of which nothing can be the cauſe but this pure Mercury and its ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur; all which reaſons invite us to give you the deſcription of this following Regulus.</p>

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170969:294"/>and terreſtrious Filings of Iron. The Regulus being not pure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the firſt melting, you muſt therefore beat it to powder, &amp; add to it ℥ iij. of antimony in powder to accelerate the melting thereof, and put it in a new Crucible, and cauſe it again to flow in a wind-Furnace, and when it ſhall be in fuſion, throw into it ℥ ij. or iij. of very dry Niter and warm'd into a powder, and there will happen yet a ſmall ebullition; throw it immediately into the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Veſſel, &amp; knock upon it; ſeparate the Regulus from the blackiſh and impure dregs, and it will come out twice as pure and white; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thus the third time, and the dregs will be either more gray or whitiſh, which is a ſign that it begins to draw nearer the ſtate of its purity: wherefore proceed to the fourth fuſion, and alwayes with new Niter dry and warm, giving a very ſtrong fire this laſt time that the Niter may be in very good fuſion, and draw to the colour of a Partridges eye; caſt it quickly, &amp; with nimbleneſs ſtir the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Veſſel, being firſt well warmed, and turn it round, and you ſhall have a <hi>stellate</hi> or <hi>ſtarry Antimony</hi> to the very Center, white as ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and flowing already ſomething of its ſolar Tincture: for the Niter which was in fluxion on the top of it is all yellow, an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ſign with the ſtar which appears on the top of it, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus hath attained the true point of its purity and perfection, to be freely uſed in the preparation of thoſe noble Remedies which it is capable to yield.</p>

                           <head>The Solar Calcination of Antimony.</head>
                           <p>VVEE have demonſtrated above, that antimonial Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination made with Niter, were opened by it, purified and fixed, which could not be done unleſſe this ſalt did partake altogether of the nature of Light, which is found to be corporified in it: but we muſt ſhew patherically here, that the Sun, Father and ſpring of the Light, by whom Niter is generated, doth purifie and ſix Antimony much better, and with more efficacy then Niter can do; which is a kind of Calcination Philoſophical indeed, and worthy a ſon of Art, whoſe curioſity leads him to ſearch and pry into the wonders of Art and Nature; But thoſe that are ignorant of the noble Works and rare Effects of Magical and Celeſtial Fire, drawn from the Rayes of the Sun by the help of a Refracting or burning Glaſs, ſhall ſcarce believe that which we have to ſay, and are to demonſtrate upon this Subject.</p>
                           <p>For this noble and miraculous Fire preſerves and encreaſes the ſubſtance of Antimony, whereas common fire and ſalts do alter and deſtroy it, which truth we make good thus: Take xij. grains of Antimony, either mineral or common, grind it into an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palpable powder, and calcine it in common fire, or by ſalt, it yields a ſmoaky vapour of an unpleaſant ſmell and colour, which is heavy: for if this ſmoak was kept in a ſublimatory Veſſel, there would be found Flowers, which are nothing elſe but meteo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd antimony, as we will make it plain when we come to ſpeak of the ſublimation of this Mineral; which is the cauſe that the Antimony is found to be decreaſed of five or ſix graines, when the Calcination is driven and brought up to a gray or white pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which has yet a purging and emetical quality: but if you calcine the ſame weight and proportion of Antimony with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracting or burning-Glaſs, which doth concentrate the light of the Sun-beams to make it work upon the matter, this Mineral doth yield alſo vapours as when it is calcined by common fire, and conſequently it were rational that it ſhould decreaſe to the ſame proportion; but it happens otherwiſe: for the Calcination
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170969:296"/>being often reiterated, and the Antimony turned into a white powder, you ſhall finde it to weigh xv. graines inſtead of xij. that were taken at firſt, and conſequently it is encreaſed in double proportion almoſt, whereas the vapours which it hath exhaled ſhould have decreaſed it as much: but that which is yet more to be admired, and leſſe conceivable, is, that theſe xv. graines of white powder are neither vomitive nor purging, but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diaphoretical and Cordial; which doth caſt into admiration not without reaſon, the moſt curious and intelligent ſearchers of Nature, and the wiſeſt Phyſitians. But this Wonder ſhall ceaſe as ſoon as we begin to apprehend and to know, that Light is that miraculous Fire which conſtitutes the principle of Antimony, and it is the ſame now that hath prepared it. By which it appears that this noble Mineral hath a kind of natural Magnes in it ſelf, which makes it capable to attract from the higheſt Heavens this noble kin and ſimilar light, by which it is produced and ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with its vertue. This Solar Calcination is then performed in the following manner.</p>
                           <p>Let the Artiſt have a burning-Glaſs of three or four foot Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, made with two concave pieces of Glaſs joined together, the two concavites within looking one towards another, the convexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without, and let there be a hole to fill up the concave ſpace with clear water; for this Glaſs will concentrate more beames, and calcine better then if it was all of one piece, and broader in Diameter. The pieces muſt be well glued together with Ich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyocolla or Fiſh glew, that the water may not come out again; it alſo muſt be fitted upon a Pedeſtal or Foot, wherein is a Screw to raiſe and depreſſe it according as occaſion ſhall require; it muſt have moreover a pair of green glaſs Spectacles to help the ſight and enable the Artiſt to lead the edge of the Sun beams upon the Antimony, and move it as it goes on calcining; otherwiſe the vivacious quickneſſe of this light ſhould impair and ruine the ſight; place the Antimony upon a well poliſhed Porphyry ſtone very ſmooth, and have a grinding ſtone ready at hand to grind it when it is turned into crums. The Antimony muſt be made into the ſubtileſt powder that can be: and a great care muſt be taken in guiding the light, ſtirring the matter and grinding it, and ſo proceed till it be reduced into a white powder, which gathers
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170969:296"/>it ſelf no more into crums, neither yields any ſmoak or exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when the light is directed upon it, or when it is put upon a red glowing piece of Iron, which is an argument of its fixedneſſe. The Stellat or ſtarry Regulus may much better be calcined in the common Antimony, and the Diaphoretical Remedy prepared therewith, ſhall prove much more efficacious and better. The Doſis may be from ij. grains to xij. to be uſed in all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes we have rehearſed above, and experience will make it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that this Remedy is comparably better and of more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency then the common Diaphoretick. The Figure here annexed will demonſtrate all what belongs to this Operation much more natively and plainly then our Pen can repreſent it; and ſo put we an end to the products of the dry Calcination of Antimony, and come to the moiſt Calcination, which is Precipitation.</p>

Have alſo an earthen ſtopple very exactly fitted to the hole through which you are to throw the Antimony. The pots being well luted, and the Lute dry, give it firſt a gentle fire, then encreaſe it until the firſt pot be glowing red on all ſides; then begin to throw in it <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ij. of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony in powder, and not above at once, renew with as much every half quarter of an hour, and alwayes maintain the fire that the pot may grow more red: you may keep doing this as long as you will, according to the quantity of matter you intend to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, and you ſhall finde your antimony to be ſublimated into gray, white, yellow, and ſometimes red flowers, according to the managing of the fire. The Flowers are not much in uſe for purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſick perſons, by reaſon of their violent Operation, for they are properly the ſulphur of Antimony, but they are fit to prepare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Remedies after they have been duly corrected.

                           <p>IT is neceſſary we ſhould deliver ſome Notes upon this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before we deſcribe it: for it hath been made ſo many wayes, and Authors entertain to this day ſo various opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, that an Artiſt will be much put to it, to know what to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. For they have firſt been of opinion, that the ſublimated Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury did contribute very much to the purging vertue of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies as are prepared with this Oyle, and that the ſubſtance of the Mercury did come over the Helm and make part of this Oyle,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170969:301"/>which nevertheleſſe is neither true nor probable, as the ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mercury with Sulphur and Antimony doth peremtorily evince, even as the remainder of the Mercury which is vivified again into a Body of running Quick-ſilver, either in the Retort or Recipient. But if this Oyle be made with the Regulus of the Antimony, there is no ſublimation at all, becauſe the Regulus is deveſted of its external and courſe Sulphur; but all the Mercury is quickened again in its own weight, except the ſpirits of thoſe Salts that have forſaken him to work upon the Antimony, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved it to convert it into Butter. But the proof is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing yet, if the Sons of Art will take the pains to receive that Emetical powder, which is made from this Butter into a Regulus by the help of Salt, Tartar and Niter, by which it appears that this powder is nothing elſe but pure Antimony. And the laſt and ſureſt proof is, that this Butter of Antimony may be prepared without the mixture of ſublimate Mercury: for if you take only Vitriol, common ſalt, and Antimony, you may draw an icy Oyle which will be of the ſame nature of that which is prepared with Sublimate, except that it ſhall not be ſo ſubtile and penetrative, the ſpirits of the groſſe ſubſtances being not ſo capable of pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating or well diſſolving the Antimony, as are the ſpirits coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated with corroſive Sublimate. The ſecond Note is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doſis of the Sublimate: for ſome do take equal parts, others the double, and others more or leſſe; but as a true Son of Art muſt perform his operations without Heſitancy, and with a real knowledge of the matters he works upon, and of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal action, he muſt lay as an indubitable Axiome and truth, that the Diſſolvent which is the Agent, muſt ever be predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in weight over the diſſoluble ſubſtance, and ſo he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail to work with ſucceſſe, if he takes three parts to one. Some do rank this Work amongſt the Mercurial Operations, and do call it <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> or <hi>Life Mercury,</hi> but we did chuſe to put it amongſt the preparations of Antimony, for the reaſons above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170969:301"/>muſt be void, and fit a Recipient with a narrow Neck, that the Noſe of the Retort may not come into this Neck above an inch, for the need there is to cauſe the icy Oyle to melt and flow when it coagulates it ſelf in the ſaid neck of the Retort or of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient; lute the joints only with paper and Meal-pap, and give it an open fire gently by degrees, until the vapours and drops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to aſcend, and ſo keep it in that ſtate until ſome matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſublimate on the top of the Retort, for it is a ſign that the Cinnabar and Vermilion begins to riſe; then take off the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient, and ſubſtitute another, becauſe that which ſhould ſtill down, might in ſome kind ſpoil and prejudice that which ſhould be contained in the firſt: this done, encreaſe the fire vigorouſly, and even encompaſſe the Retort to the top with burning coales, placing them above gently, to drive all the ſublimation into the neck of the Retort, and the reſt of the Mercury which ſhall not have ſulphur enough to be coagulated into Cinnabar ſhall quicken again, as it will appear; after the ſublimation is ended, ſeparate the Cinnabar from the running Mercury, and keep this laſt for the ſame uſes as you do common Quick-ſilver. But the Cinnabar may be uſed for preparing Trochisks, to perfume thoſe that ſhall be in a courſe of cure of the Pocks. They are alſo uſed in Pills in Venerean Diſeaſes, and all the dependances of it, becauſe this Antimonian Sulphur which hath cleft to the Mercury, and hath coagulated it, is of a much more exalted Vertue then common Sulphur, inſomuch as the one joined to the other, doth purifie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the maſſe of the blood, and hinder all corruptions which may be generated in the parts dedicated to copulation.

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170969:302"/>congeal the diſtilſing Liquor, cauſe it to melt with a well kindled coal, drawn by degrees near the neck of the Recipient and the Retort. The Rectification being ended, put the third part of what is diſtilled in a Viol, which ſhall be the ice or glacial Oyle of Antimony or its Butter, which hath no other uſe but for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward applications, to hinder Gangrenes and the growing of dead fleſh, the dead part being only rubbed and beſmeared over, either with Cotton wooll or a Pencill. The ſame may be done alſo upon peſtilential Boyls, which it will dead immediately, ſo as the ſcar eaſily will ſeparate from it, without any greater mortification of the fleſh; and moreover the cure is far eaſier: this Oyle chiefly is very uſeful for Surgeons to make Cauteries or Iſſues on a ſudden, hinder the rottenneſſe of bones and advance the exfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, wherefore it is alſo a very convenient Cauſtick to bring to perfection the cure of moiſt and weeping Fiſtula's; the two other parts are fit for Emetical powder and mineral Bezoar, as we ſhall ſay hereafter.</p>

                           <p>℞ Half of what was left of your glacial oyle of Antimony, and cauſe it to melt if it be coagulated; if not, pour it juſt as it is in a pan, where there may be about <abbr>lb</abbr> iij. of diſtilled Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, and it will immediately precipitate into a Body white as ſnow, becauſe the ſalts which did hold faſt the Reguline and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial part of the Antimony in the diſſolution, join now to the water which is their Diſſolvent, and ſo forſake the Body of the Antimony, even as they had forſaken the ſublimate Mercury in the foregoing diſtillation. The precipitation being ended, ſtir all with a wooden Peſtle very clean, to join exactly the ſaline ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits with the water, then let it reſt, and the water being very clear, ſeparate as much as you can by decantation without ſtirring the bottom and keep the water by it ſelf; then pour new water until the pan be full, and ſo proceed in the Lotion till the water comes off inſipid; then ſeparate all the water by filtration, and dry the powder betwixt two papers very ſlowly, and ſo ſhall you have an Emetical powder white and pure, which by ſome is called <hi>powder
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170969:302"/>of Algarot,</hi> from <hi>Algorotto</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> which is ſaid to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor thereof: others improperly and falſly call it <hi>Mercurius Vitae,</hi> or <hi>Life Mercury.</hi> Some others do honour this Powder with the name of <hi>Angelick powder,</hi> or of <hi>the white Eagle,</hi> by reaſon of its rare and precious vertues. The Doſis may be from ij. <hi>gr.</hi> to vij. or viij. It is ordinarily uſed to cleanſe and purge away all the hurtful and peccant humours and matters from the body, and chiefly in the firſt Region, which this powder doth evacuate by vomiting and ſtools; wherefore it is often uſed in the Plague and malignant Feavers, diſeaſes in the Head, Pocks, running pains, cure of malignant Ulcers and Dropſie, wherein it works for the moſt part without provoking to vomit.</p>
                           <p>We have ſaid, that the firſt water in which the precipitation hath been made was to be ſet apart, becauſe it is impregnated with the vertue of thoſe ſpirits of ſalts which were uſed in the ſublimation of Mercury, and are diſcovered by their ſharp and acid taſte. If the water be drawn off by diſtillation in ſand, until it be reduced to three or four ℥ of Liquor, you ſhall have that which by Hermetical Philoſophers is called <hi>Philoſophical ſpirit of Vitriol,</hi> very efficacious and of ſingular vertue to put in Julaps and Drinks of feaveriſh perſons, and of ſuch as are troubled with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims: but above all it is of wonderful vertue for inveterate pains of the Pocks, becauſe it evacuates and drives away ſufficiently thoſe malignant and ſharp ſeroſities which do prick the membranes and all the nervous and ſinuous parts of the Body. And if it be not diſtilled, this water muſt be kept and mixt in the Drink of ſuch as are afflicted with the Pocks or Dropſie, to ſuch a proportion as to give it a pleaſant ſharpneſſe, and you ſhall ſee unexpected effects, becauſe theſe ſaline Spirits have kept yet in themſelves ſome Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Idea of the vertue and efficacy, both of Mercury and Antimony. They that will prepare a leſſe violent Emetical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and a more efficacious Mineral Bezoar, muſt diſtil their gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial oyle with good antimonial Regulus, but they ſhall then have no Cinnabar.</p>

Weigh what is come over the Helm in liquor, and add as much of dry common ſalt to it, and rectifie it in a regulate heat, ſo as all what ſhall diſtil may come away fair and clear from it, and nothing of muddineſſe.</p>

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170969:307"/>into an Oyle, or to ſpeak more properly, into a red liquor, which will leave ſome feces on the glaſs Table.

It is fit and uſeful for all the Diſeaſes, to which we related above that the firſt was proper, with the ſame precautions and the ſame Doſis.</p>
                           <p>But Note, that the Artiſt muſt not throw away the remainder of theſe two Tinctures: but rather keep them to extract the ſalt thereof, as we ſhall teach in its place.

We muſt nevertheleſſe ſay ſomething of their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal in general terms, before we come to the particular deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo give a general Idea and Proſpect of ſuch Operations as are performed upon ſalts.</p>
                        <p>The original and ſpring of mineral ſalts cannot otherwiſe be
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170969:312"/>conceived then intellectually, and by the compariſon which a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſopher muſt make of ſenſible and known things, with thoſe that are hidden and removed from knowledge. For as he can perceive ſome ſalinous ſubſtances to be generated in Animals and Vegetables, from the ſuperfluity of their food and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or by ſome action of their internal heat, or coagulation of their Tartar naturally coagulable; even ſo doth he conceive the great World to be filled with a ſpirituous and luminous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance analogous to food, which maintains the generation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of all things by the help and miniſtery of heat; and when this ſpirituous and lucid Aliment hath once ſtamped his chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter and efficacy in any ſubſtance or place, and that it begins to contract a heat in it ſelf, and to overflow, there mineral ſalts are generated; and according as the matrices where this coagulation is made are different, ſo likewiſe are produced ſalts of a different &amp; diſtinct nature: ſuch as are common ſalt, ſalt Gem, Allom, Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter, Vitriol, to which is added likewiſe Armoniack ſalt, though prepared by Art. The preparations of ſalts in general are, Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Calcination, Diſtillation, Sublimation, Fixation and Liqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We will give examples of all theſe operations, when we deſcribe every one of theſe ſalts in particular, the better to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Sons of art, and proceed ſtill as we have done hitherto, with the leaſt poſſible confuſion.</p>

                           <p>THere are two kind of Calcinations of ſalt, Decrepitation, and Fuſion. <hi>Decrepitation</hi> is nothing elſe but the calcination of ſalt in an earthen pot not glazed with a circular fire, until the ſalt makes no moncracks or noiſe; the end of it is by reaſon of mixing the ſalt with other ſubſtances in ſome operations, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when the fire works upon it, it crawles, leaps and ſtirs, and ſo might ſcatter and diſcompoſe the ſaid ſubſtances join'd with it, which happens not when it is decrepitated; beſides, that this Calcination deprives it alſo from its phlegm and moiſture: but if it be too much urg'd by the fire, the acid ſpirit flyes alſo away:
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:170969:313"/>wherefore the Artiſt muſt here govern the fire gently and with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, to make it rather a violent Exſiccation, then ſuch a Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as might bereave the Body of the ſalt from its active Spirit.</p>
                           <p>The Calcination made by fuſion, is nothing elſe but the melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the decrepitated ſalt in a Crucible in the wind-furnace; if this ſalt be kept melted in a warm and dry place, it will preſerve it ſelf in a lump, to be uſed when there ſhall be occaſion; But if it be expoſed to the ayr, it diſſolves in water, which muſt be filtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and put in a Bottle; it is that which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> calls <hi>Sal ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; aqua ſalis,</hi> diſſolved ſalt, or water of Salt. There is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a third Calcination of ſalt, called <hi>the fixatory Calcination,</hi> which is made with equal parts of Common ſalt and quick-lime, which is put in an earthen unglazed pot, and being exactly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, place in a wind-Furnace in a violent heat until it melts to a lump; which done, ceaſe the fire, and diſſolve the lump in Rain-water, filtrate and evaporate to a dry bottom, and reiterate ſo often this Calcination with quick lime, that at laſt it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a fuſible ſalt, which is uſed for extracting the Tincture of Metals, upon which proceſſe the Sons of Art may make their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, for this is not without ſome Myſterie.</p>
                           <p>Having delivered the manner of theſe general Preparations, we muſt ſay ſomething in general alſo of the <hi>vertues of Common ſalt,</hi> before we come to the particular application of thoſe that are found in each particular preparation. Common ſalt is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good for cleanſing all rotten, putrid and hollow Ulcers, to reſolve all Tumors and Boyls, but chiefly peſtilential ſores; it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes the fire of burnings, dryes ſcabs and itch, takes away mange, reſolves extravaſated blood, and removes the lividity or blewiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Contuſions and bruiſes, aſſwages the Toothach and pains of the Head and Gout: but for all this the uſe is only external, mixt in Water, Vinegat or Urine according to the diſtemper; the beſt for all theſe purpoſes is that which hath been melted without addition, becauſe its internal ſulphur begins to produce it ſelf, as it appears by the redneſſe of its colour. But if ſalt hath many vertues in outward applieations, it poſſeſſes no leſſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſeveral remarkable ones internally uſed: for it doth heat and dry, cleanſes and purges, hath a gentle aſtriction, conſumes
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:170969:313"/>ſuperfluities, penetrates, digeſts, opens, cuts phlegm and tough humours, provokes luſt, reſiſts putrefaction and venoms: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore it is of ſingular uſe to correct the crudities of the ſtomach, quicken appetite, and helps the recovery of it when loſt, removes obſtructions of the Belly and Reines, and is good againſt griping of the Guts and Collick: Finally according to <hi>Baſilius</hi> it is the nobleſt and beſt of Aromats, and the true Balſom of Nature.</p>

But before we come to the deſcription of it, let us make ſome neceſſary Notes: for is it not firſt a very ſtrange thing, that the moſt part of thoſe which deſcribe this Operation, will have the ſalt to be decrepitated? but as we have ſaid above, that violent Exſiccation, not to ſay Calcination, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates and takes away from the ſalt its volatile ſpirit, phlegm, and almoſt alwayes the beſt part of its acid ſpirit, which ought not to be done, ſince the volatile ſpirit and phlegm have alſo their uſes in Phyſick, and it is not fit the Artiſt ſhould want of skil and knowledge, and loſe that which he may eaſie preſerve without any way endangering his Operation, provided he obſerves well the degrees of fire. The Artiſt muſt alſo note in the ſecond place, that ſome do mix ſalt with the heterogeneous matters, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby to facilitate the diſtillation thereof; as for example, burnt Allom and Colchotar of Vitriol; but they do not conſider, that by this meanes they alter and change the vertue of the ſpirit of Salt. Some other do mix ordinary Clay, taking no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that oftentimes this earth is impregnated with ſome mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of metallick or mineral ſeed, as it is evident by the ſmell of the ſmoak, phlegm of Kills where Bricks or Tiles are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily back't, and likewiſe of Potters Furnaces; ſo that all things well conſidered, the Artiſt muſt chooſe ſuch kind of Earth or Clay
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:170969:314"/>which may be of a moſt fix nature, and contribute the leaſt of its quality to the ſpirit of ſalt; Now amongſt all the ſeveral kinds, that which is called <hi>Sigillated</hi> or fine <hi>Bolus,</hi> are of a nature which cannot at all bring any alteration to the ſalt, unleſſe to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: wherefore we would have either of theſe two uſed for the diſtillation of this Spirit, which is made as we will now declare, ſo as to hinder the fuſion or melting of the ſalt.</p>

The Lute being well dryed, give it firſt a gentle fire fit to warm only, and modifie both the matter and Veſſel, and when the drops ſhall begin to fall, and the body of the Recipient to grow warm, proceed ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and gently in your work; for it is a ſigne that the volatile ſpirit of ſalt, begins to free and diſ-intangle himſelf from the Body, and as it is a ſubtile and fiery ſpirit, you muſt ſtop the Regiſter and moderate the fire, until the firſt rage of it be allayed, for it is at that inſtant and nick of time that the whole operation runs more danger, becauſe this ſulphureous ſpirit is coagulated with difficulty; this will laſt ordinarily four or five houres, after which the acid ſpirit begins to come forth, which appears by vapours and white clouds which fill up the Recipient; then may the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt freely encreaſe the fire without fear of any danger, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it ſtronger and ſtronger, until the flame comes forth
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170969:314"/>through the Regiſter, and the neck of the Retort appears red as fire through the body of the Recipient; this Operation cannot be well compleated in leſſe ſpace then of xxx. houres, after which ceaſe the fire, and the next day open your Veſſels, wherein you ſhall finde in the Recipient a liquor mixt with the volatile ſpirit the phlegm, and the acid ſpirit of the ſalt, ſome do add to this the oyle of Salt, but improperly. Pour all theſe into a Cucurbite and place it in <hi>B.

M.</hi> the heat whereof is too weak and inſufficient for this purpoſe, If the Artiſt hath a deſign to apply the acid ſpirit of ſalt to phyſical uſes, he needs not rectifie it any more, for it hath an excellent and very pleaſant acidity as it comes out of <hi>B. M.</hi> wherefore he may preſerve of this a third or one half part for his uſe, and put the Cucurbite in ſand to draw the other half by diſtillation, and ſo ſhall he have a true acid ſpirit of ſalt very clear and very pleaſant, and that which remains in the bottom of the Cucurbite will be of a yellowiſh colour, heavy, and of a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and violent ſharpneſſe, fit to be uſed in the diſſolution of Metals, and chiefly ſtones; this is that ſubſtance which improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is called <hi>Oyle of Salt.</hi>

So that we have no more to do now, then to add the proprieties and vertues of ſeveral ſubſtances drawn and proceeding from the Common Salt.</p>
                           <p>Firſt then, <hi>the volatile ſulphureous ſpirit</hi> is a good Cephalick
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:170969:315"/>and Sudorifick, wherefore it may be given from ij. p. to x. in Broths and appropriated waters, to thoſe which are troubled with Megrim, or any other Headach; it is alſo very excellent to be mingled in the ordinary drink of feaveriſh or aguiſh perſons, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying thirſt, and aſſwaging their reſtleſneſſe.

But as it is not our deſign to treat generally of Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter, ſo will we reſtrain our ſelves to ſpeak of it here as only of a mineral ſalt, which is extracted from fat and fruitful Earth. Wherefore a Lye is prepared with water which this ſalt coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates with its ſelf, as it appears by the fuſion of Niter, which by the action of the fire loſes all its aquoſity, ſo that there remains in it nothing but the taſte and vertue of an Urinous and Lixivial ſalt, which properly is nothing elſe but that fat and frui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>We ſay then, that Salt-peter is a ſulphural ſalt, partly vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and mixt with another earthly ſalt of a ſaline and bitter taſte, extracted from fat Earth's or Grounds, and from the mines of old Buildings; as likewiſe from Vaults of Cellars and Stables, the Earth having received the impreſſion and being impregnated with the Excrements and Urines of Beaſts, the volatile ſalt whereof did join and imbody it ſelf with the ſalt of the Earth, and theſe two being knit and indiviſibly united together by the power and action of the light and ayr upon it, and of the <hi>Archeus</hi> of the Earth which is the Director of all mineral generations, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts do call it <hi>the Chymical Ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170969:317"/>fixed ſalt, which of neceſſity muſt be depurated and ſeparated from it that it may be without mixture. The viſible notes of that purity, are the length of the Needles, their whiteneſſe and tranſparency, and the hexagonal Figure which this ſalt takes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in its chryſtallization: moreover, there is the taſte which muſt be of a harſh acidity and ſharpneſſe, ſomewhat bitter and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſaline ſowriſhneſſe: nevertheleſſe, all theſe marks are not yet abſolutely concluding for its goodneſſe and purity; wherefore the Artiſt muſt have his recourſe to that tryal which is made by fire; Let him then take a burning coal, and put one or two <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> of Niter upon it, and ſo let it burn and evaporate into the ayr; if nothing remaines upon the coal, the action of fire being ovet, it is a true ſign of the goodneſſe and purity of the Salt-peter; but he ſhall judge of the value and goodneſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greater or leſſer quantity of fixed ſalt which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines upon the coal. Phyſitians are in debate amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the firſt qualities of Niter; for ſome believe it to be cold, others contrariwiſe hot; but without loſing time about theſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, we will ſay generally the vertues of Niter, by the rehearſal of which it ſhall appear that the laſt are better grounded then the firſt in their Aſſertion, ſince it reſiſts putrefaction, quenches thirſt, and cooles powerfully ſick and languiſhing perſons, chiefly feaveriſh Bodies, but it doth not produce ſuch an effect by any cold quality, but rather by the quickneſſe and ſubtility of its parts, which inſinuates and cauſes the Patient's Drink to penetrate from the center of the body to the Circumference; and moreover, <hi>becauſe</hi> this Salt hath in it ſelf a ſulphur and ſubtile ſpirit which recreates and ſtrengthens the <hi>Archeus,</hi> ſo as to diſpoſe him to meliorate and better qualify thoſe functions which it does exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe: add to this that Niter doth cut and attenuate ſlimy humors, and muſcilagineous matters and tartarous coagulations, which are the cauſe of obſtructions; it reſolves congealed blood and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes paines. It is given to perſons troubled with Pleureſie, hot and putrid Feavers, againſt gravel in the Kidneys and Bladder, and heats of Urine. The uſe of it is alſo very commendable in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, againſt inflammations in the Throat and Quinſy.

This is true fixed Niter, much altered from its firſt nature; for it is no more volatile or apt to be turned into Chryſtals, but contrariwiſe turns expoſed to the ayre into a liquor which is ſubtile and penetrating, hath an urinous and lixivial taſte like unto ſalt of Tartar, but yet more biting and more penetrating. We are beholding to <hi>Glauber</hi> for the invention of this Liquor, who hath given us the deſcription thereof under the name of <hi>Liquor alkaheſt,</hi> fit to draw the Tinctures of all natural Bodies, whether Animals, Vegetables or Minerals, and to ſpeak truly, this Liquor hath in it ſomething very conſiderable, being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of extracting the ſulphurs of Metals, provided they have been well opened before; thoſe of Minerals do eaſily yield unto it, from whence it may be concluded that it takes in an inſtant the ſulphurs and volatile ſalts of Animals and Vegetables. If any Chymical Artiſts have a curioſity for theſe noble Oparations, they ſhall finde them in the Book which this great and famous Artiſt hath given us thereof. But there is left much matter of ſpeculation and Philoſophy upon this fixation of Niter, which is made by the Vegetable ſulphur of Coals, which doth change it into the nature
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:170969:319"/>of ſalt Alkali, whoſe taſte is urinous and lixivial; this ſalt being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of fertilizing the worſt Earth's, if the ſeeds to be put in be prepared with a Liquor made of this ſalt and ſome other Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, this admirable Salt ſo nouriſhing and invigorating the bud or ſprout of the ſeed, that it multiplyes to ſo high a number as to ſeem altogether Hyperbolical, and fabulous to thoſe which appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend not the hidden myſterie which Nature doth extract from the light of Spirits and Salts, and how the ſperm of the ſeed finds in this ſaline Liquor that which is analogous to its principle, doth greedily ſuck and attract it, for which reaſon being as it were dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſtrengthened, it ſhoots and puts forth a more vigorous and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ſtalk, yielding eares and graines of Corn above all belief, as it hath been ſeen and tryed in <hi>Paris</hi> ſome yeares ſince. But to make this Aſſertion more plain and palpable, let us reflect upon the practice of the Husbandman in <hi>Britany</hi> and the Forreſt of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermes;</hi> who meeting with unfruitful and barren grounds, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing nothing but Heath and Fern, a kind of wild Flag and Broom, uſe to pare off the upper part or moale of their ground, pluck off the Broom and Fern, and drying all in heaps ſomething diſtant one from the other, ſet it on fire, leaving after the heavenly influences and Rain to work upon this calcined Earth, containing the Alkali of all the plants fixed by their own ſulpbur; this Alkali aſſiſted by the ſulphur hath contracted a fatneſſe and clammy moiſture, heavy and of ſlow motion, which communicated to the lightneſſe, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and too great poroſity of the Earth, cauſes it to keep with it a kind of greedineſſe and delectation, a pleaſant ſubſtance and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment; and as ſoon as the Rain doth abound and exuberate, it cannot ſo ſoon be disjoined from it, neither carried away by the violent heat of the Sun by reaſon of its fixedneſſe; and ſo it comes to paſſe, that when theſe Husbandmen have plowed and ſowed their grounds, they reap ſtore of Rye for the firſt year and Oates in the ſecond. We brought in this ſtory only to the end that the Artiſt may reflect with his meditation upon this ſalt, and note the better its worth and excellency, which proceeds from nothing elſe but the myſterie of Nature contained in the Salt-peter, which he muſt ſeek by his induſtry how to free and diſ-ingage.</p>

But the Artiſt muſt be preadmoniſhed to take heed, when he comes to unlute the Veſſels and pour out this red ſpirit, for it is ſo vaporous, ſubtile and volatile that it would endanger and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focate him, or it may be cauſe him to loſe all by breaking his Veſſels: wherefore let him ſtand above the Wind and ſtop his Noſe, not opening the mouth, and taking very great heed in the pouring out of it; and to this end let him have both his Bottle and Funnel in great readineſſe, that he may meet with no ſtop.

Our Artiſt muſt take for the ſubject of his work of the ſecond kind of Vitriol, if he will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ſuch Remedies from it, as his hopes do lead him to: for the firſt kind which holds of Silver or Copper, hath too much of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick earth, and very little of acid ſpirit. The ſecond which is blewiſh, is aluminous and terreſtrial, and hath ſcarce any good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity in it, but only a courſe and excrementitious earth, which has little or none of metallick Tincture: wherefore let him ſtill gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally chuſe of the ſecond for his operations, unleſſe he hath ſome peculiar intention of his own, or that the Author which he follows doth tye him to it, and preſcribe poſitively ſo.</p>
                           <p>After the choyce of Vitriol we muſt come to the proprieties and general Vertues thereof, which are to heat, deſiccate, aſtringe or bind, and excite violent vomiting, conſtipate, open, and kill wormes. As for external applications it provokes ſneezing, if put in the noſtrils, and applyed to the orifice of the Veſſels open, or to wounds, doth ſtop the blood.

                           <head>Of the Purification of Vitriol and manner of Preparing the Gelly.</head>
                           <p>WEE have ſo often already made mention of the Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Salts, that it will be no difficult matter to lead the Artiſt to underſtand that of Vitriol: it is performed two ſeveral wayes and upon two ſeveral intentions. The firſt is but a plain diſſolution of Vitriol in Rain-water, followed with filtration, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporation to a Pellicula or thin skin and chryſtallization. The ſecond muſt be done in diſtilled <hi>May</hi> dew-water; but the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and filtration being made, the Artiſt muſt put his liquor to digeſt in <hi>B. M.</hi> during the ſpace of a Philoſophical moneth, and he will finde a skin ſeparated by the liquor on the top of it, and feces precipitated in the bottom, which muſt be yet ſeparated by filtration, and this digeſtion continued until the Vitriol doth caſt forth no more impurity; after which evaporate it ſlowly and chryſtallize. The firſt chryſtallization or purification takes only away the ſuperficial and outward foulneſſe; but the ſecond ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates the very central impurity; The firſt Vitriol may be made uſe of in all common and vulgar operations, but the ſecond is to be kept for extraordinary preparations, which are the Tinctures and Arcana's.</p>
                           <p>The Son of Art ſhall meet alſo in ſeveral Authors with a kind of preparation they call <hi>Gilla,</hi> which are only fit for Vomits, and are nothing elſe properly, but purified Vitriol ſeparated from their metallick earth: but as theſe Remedies are for the moſt part violent, and particularly the <hi>Gilla</hi> prepared with blew Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, my advice is to abſtain from them, and to make uſe of the purification of white Vitriol, which is done by diſſolving of it four times in a little Centaury water, filtrated, evaporated, and reduced to Chryſtals: for this Water doth not only encreaſe its emetick faculty, but moreover doth ſpecificate it to become an excellent Remedy againſt Feavers. The Doſis may be from x. grains to ℈ iv. in Broths, lukewarm Beer, ſome Decoction or convenient Water: it provokes vomiting very gently, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:170969:332"/>the ſtomach from all impurities and foulneſſe, checking the appetite, and cauſing diſguſt of meat, headach and fluxions: it is good againſt diſeaſes of the Ventricle, tertian Agues and quotidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Feavers, wormes in the Belly, Plague and growing Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſie.</p>

                           <p>THe Calcination of Vitriol is performed ſeveral wayes and for ſeveral intentions.

                           <p>WEE have juſt immediately before taught how the ſulphur of Vitriol or its Metallick earth was to be ſeparated by precipitation, and the ſublimation teaches how the Flowers of it are to be ſevered from it, which are nothing elſe but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Copper or Iron, which is found in all the kinds of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol. Our purpoſe of giving this Preparation, is only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to the Artiſt the truth of the compoſition of things.

After this, take care to edulcorate well the red browniſh earth which remaines after the ſalt is extracted, and to dry and keep it for its uſe, which is both inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.

The moſt dangerous and pernicious of all is the red kind; the yellow much leſſe, being not ſo hot, nor ſo much exalted as the red; and the white is the leaſt hurtful, becauſe part of his heat, corroſiveneſſe and venom, hath been corrected by the ſalt with which it was ſublimated. All three are deadly poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and moſt dangerous; for they poſſeſſe ſo evil and ſo ſtrange an acrimony, and ſo great an enemy to the vital Balſom, that they immediately raiſe fearful and ſtupendious accidents if inwardly taken, or outwardly applyed; for they bring immediately Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, cauſe percluſions of hands and feet, cold ſweats, palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the heart, Syncops and ſwoonings, vomiting, eroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, gripings, noiſe and great rumbling in the belly, and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thirſt and prodigious heat. All this malignity neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe may be taken away and corrected by Chymical preparation, and the venom of it made a Remedy capable of much good both outwardly and inwardly: but notwithſtanding this unprepared Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenick is ſometimes uſed; for in time of Plague it is a Preſervative worn in a bag hung to the neck in form or manner of an <hi>Amulet</hi> or <hi>Periapt.</hi> It is alſo uſed in Depilatories, and ſometimes with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

But this is not the place to ſpeak of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſulphurs of things, which do conſtitute to the beſt part of their eſſence and being: for we will now treat only of that Rozin and earthly fat of the earth, which is mixed with ſome portion of an acid and vitriolick ſubſtance, commonly called <hi>Brimſtone</hi> in Shops and Chymical Laboratories. There is two kinds of it, the one Natural, the other Artificial: the natural is that which is called <hi>Sulphur vivum,</hi> or which hath not paſſed through fire, and the Artificial is that which is extracted from thoſe peble ſtones or fire-ſtones, whereof we have ſpoken in the operations
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:170969:343"/>of Vitriol; they that will know how it is made, muſt conſult the moſt learned <hi>Georgius</hi>] <hi>Agricola,</hi> which hath wrote about Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and Minerals.</p>
                           <p>The Artiſt muſt for his Operation chuſe the pureſt Brimſtone, as that which is in ſmall cakes of a gray colour inclining to green, eaſie to inflame, burning without intermiſſion, and ſending forth a more blewiſh then whitiſh flame; and if this Brimſtone is not to be met with, let him have recourſe to yellow Brimſtone, which is in bigger cakes, and may be ſubſtituted in the place of the other: he muſt nevertheleſſe try whether it eaſily inflames and burns conſtantly; for if it doth not ſo, it is too much indigeſted, and by its eaſie extinction doth ſhew its ſelf to participate yet too much of Vitriolick nature. The vertues and qualities of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone are noble and efficacious before its preparation: for it is generally devoted to the Breſt, and the cure of all diſeaſes which do moleſt and afflict the ſame; it opens, outs, reſiſts putrefaction and venom, as alſo the biting of venomous creatures; it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes ſweating, ſoftens and allayes the irritations and irregular motions of the <hi>Archeus:</hi> wherefore it is uſed againſt P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if crude Sulphur hath ſo noble and ſo great vertues and proprieties, what may not be expected from this Mineral, when according to the precepts and directions of Chymiſtry, which only aimes at the correction and melioration of ſubſtances upon which Artiſts do work, it ſhall be either opened or fixed, diſſolved or coagulated, precipitated or ſublimated! the ſons of Art ought then to ſpend their time and care in working upon this Mixt, as upon one of the chief Inſtruments, put in their hands by the power of the Creator, to draw from it variety of noble and good Remedies, with which he may charitably ſupply the wants and neceſſity of many poor Patients.</p>

                           <p>AS we have ſaid heretofore that Tartar was purified by diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, percolation or ſtraining, and chryſtallization, and Antimony by its reduction into Regulus, ſo do we ſay here, that the Brimſtone is only purified from its feces and earthly ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by ſublimation into Flowers, which are abſolutely nothing elſe but a well purified Brimſtone; to prepare well theſe Flowers, you muſt chuſe of the beſt Brimſtone and bray it groſly, then put a Cucurbite of earth in ſand, the bottom near the plate of Iron on which it ſtands, having but the thickneſſe of a finger of ſand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween; put <abbr>lb</abbr> 
                              <hi>ſs.</hi> of Brimſtone at every time, and cover it with a Head which muſt not be luted; have another alſo warm in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to ſubſtitute into the place of this which lyeth on the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbite, when it ſhall be filled with Flowers; after you have given it a gentle and gradual fire of ſublimation: there muſt alſo be a ſmall Matraſs for a Recipient, to receive at firſt a little portion of ſharp fine ſpirit, which riſes before the Flowers and condenſeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to liquor in the Limbeck. Thus proceed taking away the Flowers, and ſubſtituting a Head to the former taken away, until you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the greateſt part of the ſulphur to have aſcended into Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; after which you may put again another <abbr>lb</abbr> φ. and thus go on till you have enough for your purpoſe. But you muſt be nimble in exchanging the Heads or Limbecks, leſt that the ayre ſhould ſet the Brimſtone on fire, and if that ſhould happen, let it be extinguiſhed with aſhes or burnt Allom. You muſt alſo regulate the fire conveniently until the ſublimation begins to work, and entertain it in the ſame ſtate; otherwiſe too much heat would melt the Flowers, before they were ſufficiently carried up into the Limbecks Head.</p>
                           <p>Now there are ſome that do add Colchotar with the Brimſtone &amp; melted ſalt, to be able more boldly to give it fire, thinking alſo by this way to draw more pure and ſubtile Flowers. Others do mix alſo Bolus or <hi>terra ſigillatae,</hi> which we do much better approve of then
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:170969:344"/>the proceſs of thoſe who think it enough to mix only Brick flower or ſmall Brick duſt, becauſe the oriental Boluſſes or ſigilled earths have in themſeves a ſolar ſulphur, which joyning with the flowers of Brimſtone, renders them more efficacious. But we altogether diſapprove of thoſe who with the Brimſtone do mix Gums and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes, becauſe the ſublimation cannot be performed until the Gums alſo burn, what care or precaution ſoever is had in it: wherefore it is much better if the Gums beaten to ſmall powder, be mixt with the flowers of Brimſtone already ſublimated, or what will be much better, the vertue of both be jointly extracted, as we ſhall teach here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. The flowers of Brimſtone may be 3 or 4 times ſublimated, for a greater depuration, concoction and maturation by the reiterated action of fire, which thus perfects by degrees what Nature had not yet accompliſhed, by reaſon of the heterogeneous and terreſtrial mixture of matters.</p>
                           <p>The flowers of Brimſtone reſiſts putrefaction, provokes ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and dry humours. They are given with very great ſucceſſe againſt peſtilence and all malignant Feavers, whether us'd as a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative or preſervative Remedy. They are alſo of ſingular uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Aſthma's and ſhort breath, diſeaſes of the Lungs, inveterate Coughs, Suffocations of the breaſt, Catarth's and Fluxions.

There are ſome yet that ſublimate the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Brimſtone with red Coral, and extract the Tincture thereof with oyle of Aniſeed, which they give to Conſumptive perſons as a true ſpecifick Remedy for their cure: but all theſe contrivances depending from the knowledge and experience of Phyſitians, we ſhall not inſtance upon any here to examplifie; for it is enough for us to have taught the beſt and ſureſt way of performing the plain ſublimation; for whoſoever can make the ſimple Flowers, ſhall be in much leſſe danger of erring in the preparation of thoſe that are compounded.</p>

                           <head>The Precipitation. To prepare the Milk, Cremor, Butter, or Magiſtery of Brimſtone.</head>
                           <p>WEE have ever recommended the choyce and purity of Materials, which makes us again to enjoyn hereunto the Sons of Art, not to ſpare the fair ſalt of Tartar in the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Brimſtone, although ſeveral Authors content themſelves with aſhes of Wine lees or Glaſiers aſhes, which are the ſalt of the herb <hi>Kali,</hi> to make this preparation: but beſides, that they cannot well filtrate their Tincture, by reaſon of the viſcoſity and clammineſſe of the aſhes, the Remedy is not ſo good, ſo fair, nor endowed with the requiſite vertue, becauſe theſe ſalts have not the penetrating and fiery vigour which is required for the diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Brimſtone, and the concoction and maturation of that Mineral; and this part muſt the Artiſt heed, becauſe the good or evil of his Operation depends from it; therefore you muſt proceed in it as followeth.</p>
                           <p>℞ Flowers of Brimſtone twice ſublimated, at leaſt ſome part thereof, and three parts of very pure and white ſalt of Tartar; put them in a gray earthen pot, or a glaſs Cucurbite, and pour upon xij. or xv. p. of diſtilled Rain-water, cauſe them to boyl together in ſand the ſpace of five or ſix houres, or until all the ſubſtance of the Brimſtone be diſſolved, and the liquor clean, and tinged with a very high red; and as the ebullition cauſes the Menſtruum to leſſen in quantity, add to it ſome other warm, ſtirring continually the matter, to haſten the ſooner your diſſolution. Moreover, the mixture of the ſalt of Tartar and flowers of Sulphur muſt have been made before in a Marble Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar warm and dry. The diſſolution being duly made, warm a great earthen gray pan, putting in it the clear part of the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, without any previous filtration, which cannot be ſoon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough performed, the Brimſtone returning into a body as ſoon as the Menſtruum begins to cool; pour upon the Tincture very good diſtilled Vinegar ſprinkling it every where, until the whole turns into a liquor as white as Milk, which when you ſee, fill up
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:170969:345"/>the remainder of the pan with clear and pure Spring-water, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the edulcoration and ſetling of it; then cover it, and leave the ſpace of 24 houres in a ſecure place, and ſeparate after that the clear liquor by inclination, then pour new clear water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the milky ſubſtance ſetled in the bottom, and thus continue the lotion thereof until both the ill ſmell, and lixivial taſte of the ſalt of Tartar be gone away. But note, that the firſt water muſt not be thrown away, but contrariwiſe evaporated, and ſo you ſhall finde again your ſalt of Tartar, which reverberate in a Crucible to redneſſe; then diſſolve and filtrate, and it will be as good and as pure as before, to ſerve in the ſame operation or any other whatſoever; You muſt waſh the Magiſtery of Sulphur for the laſt time in equal parts of Cinnamon, Roſe-water, and then dry it ſlowly and keep it for uſe.</p>
                           <p>But becauſe this Magiſtery cannot be made in ſmall quantity, and that the Artiſts are not alwayes provided with ſalt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar and diſtilled Vinegar, we will teach them a good and ſure way, to prepare with ſmall expence, and ar all times a milk of Sulphur or Brimſtone, which in vertue ſhall not be inferiour to the former; the Doſis and faculties whereof we will declare after we have ſpoken of the preparation of the other.</p>

                           <p>℞ Of good quick lime that hath not been expoſed to the open ayre ij. p. and j. p. of good green Brimſtone in ſmall Cakes j. p. mix them exactly together in an Iron Mortar by a long trituration, and afterwards let them boyl in a good quantity of Rain-water in a great Iron Cauldron, ſtirring continually with an Iron Slice, until three parts of the water be boyled away, and the remaining be as red as blood by the diſſolution of the brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, run it then warm through the ſtraining bag, and let the ſtrained liquor cool, then with new made Urine precipitate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it grows cold; this Magiſtery ſuffer to ſettle, and ſeparate the upper part of the liquor, and waſh it twelve or fifteen times with warm Spring-water, and when it hath no more ill taſte or
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:170969:345"/>odour left, waſh it as the foregoing Roſe and Cinnamon water, and let it dry gently, to keep for uſe. The Remedy is called <hi>the Balſom of the Lungs,</hi> which by the eradiation of its vertue, conſumes and dryes up all malignant, ſerous and watery ſuperfluities. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is uſefully exhibited to thoſe that are tormented with melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſuffocating Rheumes and Catarrh's, to Aſthmaticks and Phthiſical Perſons, and ſuch as are troubled with old and invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Coughs, or ſubject to Colick and Ventoſities, which it doth hinder and diſſipate. It is given alſo to thoſe which are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with malignant humours and ſeroſities in the joynts; it faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litates expectoration, and wonderfully ſtrengthens the breſt. The Doſis may be as much as will turn Cinnamon or Balm water to a milk white; it is given every day to the Patient morning and evening, one ſpoonful at once. Though this Remedy be highly celebrated amongſt Authors, yet our advice is to truſt rather to the Tinctures extracted from it, then to this body, yet too coarſe and material to hope from it all the good and commendable effects which are attributed unto it; we do nevertheleſſe leave it to every ones liberty to make uſe thereof, until the truth of our Aſſertion be better known by ſtudy and practice, which are the two Touchſtones by which things are to be examined and known.</p>

                           <p>THe Sons of Art have ſought long how to finde a way of Diſtilling from ſulphur of Brimſtone a good acid Spirit, which they improperly call <hi>the oyle of Sulphur,</hi> and to draw quantity from it, which hath cauſed a hundred manners of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances and proceſſes upon this Subject. They alſo have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to turn Brimſtone into an unctuous Oyle, which might be fit both for inward and outward Diſeaſes, wherein e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body hath alſo brought in his mite of experience and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to attain that end: but as we have found that Brimſtone hath been Vitriol before it could attain the Character of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur; our wonder hath been the greater, that they ſhould have laboured ſo much to get out that acid ſpirit, ſince they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:170969:346"/>and ſay themſelves, that the ſpirit of Vitriol is like in vertue and operation to that of Brimſtone; and it will be eaſier to draw lib. x. from one, them lib. ſ. from the other. We muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe notwithſtanding, that there ſhall be ſomething found more quick and ſubtile in the acid of brimſtone, then in that of Vitriol, becauſe the ſubſtance from which it is extracted hath been more exalted, more concocted and ripened then Vitriol, which is much inferiour in theſe reſpects, and conſequently more undigeſted. Wherefore we will declare here two wayes, which have ever been very ſucceſſeful unto us to draw the acid of Sulphur or Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. After which we will alſo give the Method of turning the body of Brimſtone into <hi>Oyle</hi> properly ſo called, which will be more unctuous and inflammable; and is a very conſiderable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, both in Phyſick and Surgery.</p>

They have made uſe of viſible fire and of its heat to ſtir up that inviſible one which is hidden in the Center of mixt bodies, and conſtitute the chief part of their ſoul, eſſence, efficacy and vertue: And if this only way could not bring them to their deſired ſcope, they have ſought in other Mixts ſome analogous ſubſtance, which could ſympathize and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with a proportional heat to that which they intended to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and multiply. This ſame way we do intend to hold in the maturation of common Brimſtone to correct it, and this way to ſtir up the faculties and wonderful vertues it hides under the ſhade of its body, which is the rind and cover of the light and internal fire by which it is produced.</p>
                           <p>To this end let the Artiſt take as much of well choſen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Brimſtone as he doth think fitting; then beat it to powder, and digeſt in aſhes with a moderate heat in a Matraſs, without any melting at all the ſpace of forty dayes uninterrupted; this dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion will correct the ſtench and ill ſmell of the Brimſtone, and will encreaſe the vertues thereof in a quadruple proportion, which immediately he will perceive by diſſolving a ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this digeſted Brimſtone in ſome oyle, and doing the like with other not digeſted and ripened; for the one will yield an unpleaſant ſmell as it uſes to do, and the other will rather recreate and pleaſe the ſmell then offend it. After this firſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration a ſecond muſt be put in practice, which cannot be but by the means of a ſubtile, aethereal and volarile oyle which may open the body of this Brimſtone, and make it capable of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted it ſelf into a ſubtile, penetrating and pleaſant Oyle. This Oyle muſt be none elſe but of Turpentine, drawn after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we have taught above. And as we have laid for an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:170969:349"/>and ſure Axiom, that the ſubſtance which muſt open and ſubtilitate, muſt in many degrees exceed that body that is to be opened and ſubtilitated; ſo muſt the Artiſt put viij. p. of this Oyle upon j. p. of digeſted B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is a moſt excellent Vulnerary, curing internal Ulcers, reſiſting main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corruption, and allaying all irritations and fits of the Mother; it is a wonder of Remedy againſt the Plague, Colick, Catarrh's and Fluxions, Aſthma's or ſhort breath and Empyema's, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Ulcers in the ſtomach; it abundantly provokes ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Urine, and doth work alſo by inſenſible tranſpiration. The Doſis may be from one drop to vj. in ſome appropriated Syrup, or the yolk of a new laid Egg in the morning faſting. For outward application it is an unparallel'd Remedy, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and digeſt Tartarous and ſcrophulous Tumors, as alſo to allay griefs, particulatly that of the Sciatica: Finally it may be ſaid, that this true Sulphur is none of the leaſt Maſterpieces of our Art, provided the Artiſt be punctual and ſedulous, and hath been careful to ripen and digeſt well the Sulphur, as we have preſcribed.

                           <head>Of yellow Amber or Karabe.</head>
                           <p>THe opinions of Authors who have writ about yellow Amber are very various, but principally thoſe of the former age, becauſe they wanted the light of Chymiſtry, to give them a deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of knowledge in the things of Nature: but in this latter age where we are enlightened by that noble Torch, and where it hath been ſo ſucceſſefully uſed to advance Anatomy of mixt bodies, without any other prevention of mind then to diſcover truth for our own advantage, and leave it to improve to others; Chymical examination hath taught us, that yellow Amber or <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabe,</hi> is nothing elſe but a bituminous juyce or Pitch and Rozin of the Earth well digeſted, flowing from the ſubterraneous veines of it into the Sea, where it gathers, coagulates its ſelf and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens finally more and more. There are three principal kinds thereof; The firſt which is more eſteemed and ſought for, is white and opaco us, the moſt digeſted and ripened of all, which is known by its purity, pleaſant ſmell and great quantity of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile ſalt, which is the moſt infallible token of its goodneſſe and vertue. The ſecond is yellow, which is lucid and tranſparent, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding more in oyle then in ſalt, and by conſequence more digeſted and leſſe valuable. The third is that, which between both is mixt of white and yellow, but with ſome touch of earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and impurity, which makes it inferiour in worth to the two former. All three are endowed with no common vertues: but if any will make uſe of yellow Amber for Phyſical purpoſes without any other preparation then triturating it upon a Porphyrie ſtone the whiteſt muſt ever be taken and preferred, having a Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick ſmell almoſt like flower of Roſemary, when it is a little ſtirred by friction. It is the white alſo that muſt be choſen to make the Tincture or eſſence thereof, as we ſhall teach hereafter. But the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:170969:353"/>ſecond and third ſort may be uſed for diſtillation, becauſe the pure part thereof is ſevered from the impure, and that rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation may correct the defects of the firſt diſtillation, by which the vitiouſneſſe of the natural digeſtion of <hi>Karabe</hi> is already cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and the action of fire hath ſeparated the heterogeneous and groſſe ſubſtance lurking in it. <hi>Karabe</hi> in the Perſian tongue ſignifies attractive of ſtraw, which is one of the proper qualities of Amber.</p>
                           <p>The general vertues of Amber are, to warm, deſiccate, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and bind moderately; it is principally dedicated to the head, ſpleen and Matrix. Wherefore it is very ſucceſſefully made uſe of in Catarrhs and Fluxions, Epilepſy, Apoplexy, Lethargy and Vertigo, as alſo to allay all irritations and riſings of the Spleen. It is alſo a wonderful Specifick againſt all fits of the Mother, and chiefly againſt the riſing of it and ſuffocations which it cauſes. It is alſo a true coagulated Balſom, uſed againſt bloody-flux and Gonorrhae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>The Chymical preparations of Amber are <hi>Diſſolution or Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> to make the Tincture, Eſſence or Magiſtery thereof: and <hi>Diſtillation,</hi> by the help of which its Mercurial Spirit is extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as alſo the ſubtile Oyle, Balſamick Oyle, volatile Salt, and Colophony or Roſin.</p>

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:170969:354"/>golden yellow; then open the Veſſel, draw off the liquor by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and reiterate again a new diſſolution and extraction until the ſpirit of Wine takes no more of the Tincture.

Some do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make the Magiſtery thereof, precipitating this Tincture in common water, but they are in a great errour: for it is properly to unmake or undo what hath been made with great labour, ſince the water drawing to it ſelf the ſpirit of Wine, the body of the Amber forſakes it and precipitates into a Gum or Roſin, which is not much better then white prepared Amber, except only that it is ſomewhat purer. The Artiſt then ſhall preſerve this Eſſence in liquor, and ſhall uſe it in all diſeaſes for which we have aſſigned the general vertues of <hi>Karabe.</hi> But this Remedy muſt be exhibited in ſome Syrup, as that of Cinnamon, Coral, Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Paeony or yolkes of Egges; it may alſo be given in aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real or burning Spirits, as of Juniper, Elder berries, Black Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or ſpirit of flowers of Lilly Convallium drawn with Sack, becauſe if it was given in any wateriſh liquor, the Amber would return to a body, and ſo would not produce ſo good nor ſo quick effects as when it remaines in liquor, and all its parts diſunited and volatiliz'd, that the <hi>Archeus</hi> of the Ventricle may bring all the powers thereof to action in the higheſt perfection.

                           <p>℞ White Amber reduced to an impalpable powder, as much as you will; put it in a Matraſs or Cucurbite, and pour upon it very good and very ſubtile diſtilled Vinegar four fingers high,

This digeſtion and diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be reiterated three times, but at the third time you muſt remove the fire after you have drawn off the three parts of four, adding to the remainder ℥ j. of well filtrated juyce of Lemon, or <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. of very acid and well rectified ſpirit of Vitriol; this done, go on gently in your diſtillation until the matter be well dryed, which reduce to powder and keep for uſe: for it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Medicine to provoke ſwear, and ſtrengthen the heart and its functions; it may be given with hope of very good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in Meaſels, ſmall-Pox and Pleuriſie: but above all it is a Specifick againſt the Scurvy and its dependances.

Let him then take <abbr>lb</abbr> iij. or iv. and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put them in a great Retort, ſo capacious as the matter may fill up but the third part, let him place it in a cloſe Reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory upon the cover of a pot with two fingers thick of aſhes under the bottom of the Retort, which will be to it inſtead of a Lute, and having alſo fitted to the neck of the Retort a large
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:170969:355"/>Recipient exactly luted, let him give a gentle and graduated fire until the drops of the acid ſpirit be over, and the oyle begins to appear; then he muſt encreaſe a little the fire, and regulate it ſo that the drops may follow one another. But he muſt begin to encreaſe and drive it hard when he perceives the oyle to grow thicker, and the volatile ſalt to ſublimate it ſelf, which may be known by the vapours and clouds coming forth out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, and let the fire be kept in this ſtate until the Recipient grows clear of its ſelf, which is an infallible token of the end of the operation. That which is found in the Recipient after diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion containes three diſtinct ſubſtances proceeding from one and the ſame root. The firſt is the ſpirit or Mercurial acid and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery liquor of the Amber, which comes forth in the firſt place. Secondly, the oyle which is mixed with much volatile ſalt which hath made it ſomewhat thick, unpleaſant to the ſmell, and high in colour. The third is the volatile ſulphureous ſalt, which is not the leaſt conſiderable of the three in vertue and efficacy. The Artiſt muſt know how to ſeparate skilfully theſe ſubſtances the one from the other, to uſe them each ſeverally according to the ſeveral proprieties which are in them; and this is performed in the manner following.</p>

Take then all the remaining oyle, and put it in agreat Matraſs or Blindhead, and pour upon it diſtilled Rain-water, until it be in the ſame or a little greater quantity then the oyle; cover and lute the Veſſel and put it to digeſt in aſhes in a moderate heat, ſtirring it every hour, to ſeparate the better the volatile ſalt from its oyle; for though it be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately mixed with it, becauſe the oyle is of a volatile and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous nature, yet in proceſſe of time will it come off from it, and be diſſolved and united to the water by reaſon of its ſaline nature, which eaſily joynes and unites its ſelf to water. When you ſee the water well impregnated, remove the fire, ſeparate the oyle, and filtrate the water which is full of the volatile ſalt of the Amber, as it will be perceived eaſily by the acid and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting taſte thereof; draw off again three parts of the water by ſlow diſtillation in aſhes, and put the Veſſel in a cold place, leaving
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:170969:356"/>it there the ſpace of two dayes, and you ſhall finde the volatile ſalt chryſtallized and coagulated into a red brown ſubſtance, which ſeparate from the water, and dry between two papers in a ſlow and moderate heat: continue the evaporation of the ſuperfluous water, and draw back all the ſalt, and having dryed it joyn it to the firſt, which is ever the pureſt and the beſt. You may keep part of it as it is if you think fit; if not, put it all in a ſmall Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbite, covered with a blind ſtill-Head, and ſublimate it in ſand with a well graduated heat, and ſo ſhall this ſalt riſe fair, pure, white and clean, leaving all its impurities in the bottom of the Veſſel. This volatile Salt is the beſt and moſt excellent part of Amber, worthy that Artiſts ſhould ſeek it with all imaginable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, conſidering its high vertues, which are yet more general and leſſe confined then thoſe of Amber, or its ſpirit or oyle, ſince it is the ſoul and intrinſecal eſſence thereof.

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:170969:356"/>and j. p. of decrepid ſalt, putting as much as needs to reduce all into a lump or paſte which may be framed into Pellets, or of a fit bigneſſe to go through the neck of a glaſſe Retort, which muſt be filled only half with them, and placed in a cloſe Reverbera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory with a well luted Recipient; give it firſt a gentle fire until the oyle begins to come forth bright and clear, and keep it in this ſtate, or encreaſe it by little and little gradually, until you obſerve the falling drops to begin to grow yellow, or inclining to redneſſe; then change your Recipient, and ſubſtitute another well luted to it, then encreaſe the fire ſomewhat more, to force the oyle to ſeparate it ſelfe from the leaſt atomes of bodies with which it is mixt, and thus proceed encreaſing ſtill more and more, until you finde no more ſubſtance to come forth.</item>
                                 <item>The ſecond way of rectifying this Oyle, is, in putting it with Roſe, Marjoram, and Balm-water, <hi>ana</hi> three or four pints, in a ſtill-body, and ſtilling it with the Moores Head, the Fat and the Worm, making the ſame obſervations which we have enjoyned the Artiſt heretofore for the diſtillation of vegetable Oyles, and you ſhall have an oyle of Amber fluid and clear, fit for all thoſe uſes and purpoſes which Authors do commend it for in their Writings.</item>
